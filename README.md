The iOS client source-code of the original AppMakr.com website (pre-Infinite Monkeys acquisition in late 2013).

**Note:** This source was last compiled on Xcode 7 (for reference, we're currently on version 14), so there are most likely many deprecations that will have to be resolved to get this project to run. This app package also includes the GetSocialize SDK and API which are now deprecated.

## Notable Apps Made with AppMakr
### The White House app
The earliest release of the White House app was built on AppMakr.com. You can see an [archived listing of it on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20111001003546/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-white-house/id350190807?mt=8) or [see a Wall Street Journal article](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/02/08/app-watch-the-official-white-house-app-debuts/) about it.

## Notes
Some configuration data in the `global.plist` file (tabs, feed links, app name, app icon, bundleId) were replaced with generic information to make this code inspecific to the original app download from AppMakr.com.
