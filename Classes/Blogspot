Had a thorough Google search on this. Time was ticking, I managed to find one or two Rails calendar Plugin, but when tried on my project, it did not serve the exact purpose of each date sending the Ajax request. No much help was there on this in any Rails based forum as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This finally made me to think of writing the code for generating the calendar of my own. It was indeed going to be a tough task. But I had no other choice left in-front of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shared the code for the same through my GitHub account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There in the GitHub repository you will find only a controllers folder and a views folder. Well that's all we need to get this done. If you have a Rails project up and running, you can go ahead and generate this Calendar Controller and use the code and modify it, style it as per your own requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here what I have done is, in the "calendar index" page you can see the calendar for the current month, with links for next and previous months, so that you can have a view of all the months. When you click on the next/previous links, the months partial is being updated. Similarly, onClick of each date will update a test "div" with the value of month and date. You can apply any logic here and make it work for your purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby/Rails Tips for the day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=&gt;How to get the starting day of the month ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.5)&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; date = Date.today&lt;br /&gt;=&gt; Fri, 29 Jan 2010&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; start_date = Date.parse "#{date.year}-#{date.month}-01"&lt;br /&gt;=&gt; Fri, 01 Jan 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=&gt;How to get the last day of the month ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt; last_date = (start_date &gt;&gt; 1)-1&lt;br /&gt;=&gt; Sun, 31 Jan 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=&gt;How to get the weekday of a particular date?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt; start_date.wday&lt;br /&gt;=&gt; 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href="http://nithinbekal.com" target="blank"&gt;Nithin Bekal&lt;/a&gt; who helped me in getting this work done in no time.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone uses this code for their application, please share with me the improvements made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-2231193797431776780?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2010/01/generating-calendar-with-rails.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-2939453924168887494</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2010 05:07:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-01-26T10:42:17.894+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>wordpress</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Technical Post</category><title>Custom Blog Post Reordering In WordPress</title><description>Wordpress is no doubt one of the best CMS around and with the awesome community out there contributing in all ways to make it the best of the best is really appreciative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, few days back working on a wordpress project for a client, The client came up with some requirement and that was like, he would like to manually rearrange the Posts the way he wants and not the default date ordering of Wordpress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had never heard about custom post order ever before untill the client mentioned about it and that made me look for the right plugin which would make this work out for me. And guess what, I came up with nearly 3 plugins which would serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed it on my test domain and checked it out. Whohooo! they worked and I settled with a plugin named &lt;a href="http://hungrycoder.xenexbd.com/scripts/wordpress-blogpost-reorder.html"&gt;Blog Reordering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installed it in the client's domain and then on client request documented the best way to use this plugin to reorder the posts and drafted a mail to him. Here's the mail which I prepared for the client:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: courier;"&gt;As you want the posts to be reordered manually and do not want them to show up according to the date and time settings, We have a plugin named Post Reorder which will help us to the stuff of custom reordering of posts as we want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, As it gives you the freedom to custom reorder the posts, Its kind of a manual work to reorder the posts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here's how you can achieve it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Navigate to Blog Reordering section which is at the very bottom Settings in admin page of the wordpress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Here you can find options such as "Blog reordering Settings", "Quick reorder by field" and "Blog reordering"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Let the first two option be as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. We need to worry only about the third option and that is where all reordering stuff takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.Here you can find all the posts listed down with the "ordering" numbed 1,2,....etc to the latest post you have up to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.Now its all manual task, where you have to identify the right posts of each category and number them in the order you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have 25 posts in personal category and all the 25 are randomly ordered and ordering number is also random according to the order they were posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you need not worry about the random order each of the 25 posts of "personal" category has got, you can just go ahead and number them from 1 to 25 in the order you want them to display and that's it. When you check out the personal category page, all the 25 posts will be ordered the way you have set them. Now that's called absolute freedom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if there is no name to each of your posts, then it is kind of hectic knowing which posts is which one and the only option is to identify them via their ID's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all about it. Did I miss anything relevant about this plugin ? Please do share it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-2939453924168887494?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2010/01/custom-blog-post-reordering-in.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-9180038619620366541</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2010 17:10:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-01-25T22:42:43.577+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>GitHub</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Technical Post</category><title>Share Source Code Using GitHub- It's Social Coding!</title><description>Done writing the codes of your current project? And is excited about it and want the whole developer community to know about your latest project? Then Lets Git It!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am also equally excited about my latest project and I wanted it to share with the developer community through GitHub-Social Coding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application was developed using Ruby On Rails and hence the hosting provider is HostingRails. So I have my application running up there. So all I had to do was commit the source code from HostingRails into the GitHub repository.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be explaining the exact procedure that I followed to commit the source code of my application into GitHub repository directly from HostingRails.&lt;br /&gt;I use PuTTy which is an  open source telnet and SSH Client for the Windows and Unix platforms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my application was hosted in HostingRails, I logged into it via PuTTy and I was taken into my root folder. If you are not aware of PuTTy interface, then I would say it is just a Unix Terminal for you to work on. So from the root folder I had to get in my project folder which I did using CD command.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well before we do anything , a GitHub account is necessary or else where are we going to commit all our source code! So I did create a GitHub Account and I am all set for Social Coding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I had to create a New repository.(See Images)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13PSjURa-I/AAAAAAAAA3w/N-li-qNaAEc/s1600-h/git1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="412" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13PSjURa-I/AAAAAAAAA3w/N-li-qNaAEc/s640/git1.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13PjmDLkkI/AAAAAAAAA30/EHqx87DR6Mo/s1600-h/git2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="348" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13PjmDLkkI/AAAAAAAAA30/EHqx87DR6Mo/s640/git2.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I provided all the information for creating the repository, I hit create-repository. And that's all. After I created the repository, I was redirected to the new repository page which had the basic information on how to commit the source codes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here's what i did for committing the source code for my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In PuTTy, as i was already in my application folder:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;email@email.com [~/rails/My_Project]#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next i had to initialize the git in my application:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;email@email.com [~/rails/My_Project]#git init&lt;br /&gt;Initialized empty Git repository in /home/fedenac/rails/testing/.git/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once initialized, I had to include all the folders and files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;email@email.com [~/rails/My_Project]#git add .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after that commit it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;email@email.com [~/rails/My_Project]#git commit -m 'any message here'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had to add the remote origin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;email@email.com [~/rails/My_Project]#git remote add origin git@github.com:techslam/test.git&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the above command "git@github.com:techslam/test.git" is the URl which we find at the top of the page after successfully creating the repository.(See Image)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13Pwqc1qXI/AAAAAAAAA34/LiZ7MS7dSiU/s1600-h/git3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="442" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13Pwqc1qXI/AAAAAAAAA34/LiZ7MS7dSiU/s640/git3.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finnaly we push it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;email@email.com [~/rails/My_Project]#git push origin master&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's it. When I checked my repository all my source code was ready to be shared with the wonderful development community out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Folks, what's your say on GitHub feature. I am really enjoying it and is going to explore it deeper and deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-9180038619620366541?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2010/01/share-source-code-using-github-its.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S13PSjURa-I/AAAAAAAAA3w/N-li-qNaAEc/s72-c/git1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-1037363001721589322</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2010 09:53:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-01-16T15:23:48.761+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Talks</category><title>David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals at FOWA Dublin 2009</title><description>&lt;object height="220" width="400"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3899696&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3899696&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="220"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/3899696"&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson - FOWA Dublin 2009&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/carsonified"&gt;Carsonified&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson discusses the prospects of starting a business in “The Real World”.

Its been quite a some time I am involved in this project and in the mean time learnt a lot about this CMS. The best part is that, the CTO of BrowserMedia Mr.Patrick Peak would answer to any of your doubts related to BrowserCMS. I have had a lot of questions related to BCMS and most of them were answered by him in a matter of day. So Iam really thankful to him and really appreciate the work he has been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project is taking quite a bit of time to get it completed because of some special requiremnts from the client like setting up Multi Language functionality. Though BrowserCMS don't have a built in support for i18n(As told by Mr.Patrick Peak,CTO BrowserMedia), It was a huge challenge for me to bring some unique concept of Multi Language functionality in Browser CMS. Well, I did make a quite a bit of research on this and finally came up with indeed a unique concept to get this requirement done.&lt;br /&gt;The concept has been explained to our client and is waiting to get his approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the coming posts you can expect, the Idea behind setting up the Multi Language Functionality using browser CMS. So stay tuned. Till then CiaO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby Tip of the day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To check if there is an item in an array...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt; ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird'].include?

Ruby on Rails is blessed to have a such an active community which always comes up with solutions to rails of any kind. For user authentication there is an awesome plugin called AuthLogic. I have used this plugin in an application I am currently associated with and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this post you can find step by step instruction on getting this plugin up and running in your application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installing AuthLogic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AuthLogic can either be installed as a plugin or as a gem. I would rather go with installing a gem. So from the command line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;gem install authlogic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;After installing the gem, we will be creating a very simple rails application just to test the user authentication functionality via authlogic gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So from command line create a new application named user_authentication_demo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\&amp;gt;rails user_authentication_demo -d mysql&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;after the application is created, lets just go ahead and create a dummy controller dummy method in the controller and a dummy view. This is just to have a page up and running where we will be displaying the working of user authentication functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So create a controller by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\user_authentication_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate controller home index&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;You can add some dummy text in your app/views/index.html.erb file just for fun. Working on rails, you got enough time for fun stuffs !&lt;br /&gt;(Make sure you have &amp;lt;%= flash[:notice] %&amp;gt; in there to get the flash messages)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next open up the config/database.yml find athen replace the entire content here with the following code&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;development:&lt;br /&gt;      host: localhost&lt;br /&gt;      adapter: mysql&lt;br /&gt;      database: user_authentication_demo_development&lt;br /&gt;      port: 3307&lt;br /&gt;      username: root&lt;br /&gt;      password:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;test:&lt;br /&gt;      host: localhost&lt;br /&gt;      adapter: mysql&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;production:&lt;br /&gt;      host: localhost&lt;br /&gt;      adapter: mysql&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have done is removed unwanted junk of codes from there to keep it straight and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if we run the server and go to &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/blog"&gt;http://localhost:3000/blog&lt;/a&gt;, we will be taken to the dummy page as shown below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S0DIm8BkyDI/AAAAAAAAA2w/uDyc5QklQR4/s1600-h/blog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="112" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S0DIm8BkyDI/AAAAAAAAA2w/uDyc5QklQR4/s400/blog.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be adding the user authentication to the above page. In this page we will be showing "Register","Login" links if the user is not logged in and "Edit Profile","Logout" links if the user is logged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we need to create Model and Controller for Users. First we will be generating our User Model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\user_authentication_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate model user&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;After all the associated files are created, we will edit the migration file at db/migrate/20100103124423_create_users.rb and ad the following codes in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class CreateUsers &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration  &lt;br /&gt;  def self.up  &lt;br /&gt;    create_table :users do |t|  &lt;br /&gt;      t.string :username  &lt;br /&gt;      t.string :email  &lt;br /&gt;      t.string :crypted_password  &lt;br /&gt;      t.string :password_salt  &lt;br /&gt;      t.string :persistence_token  &lt;br /&gt;      t.timestamps  &lt;br /&gt;    end  &lt;br /&gt;  end   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  def self.down  &lt;br /&gt;    drop_table :users  &lt;br /&gt;  end  &lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;AuthLogic can pretty much handle fields called email, crypted_password, password_salt and persistence_token and hence we need not bother much about them So let's go ahead and run rake to create the database tables &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\user_authentication_demo&amp;gt;rake db:migrate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Next we will have to edit the app/models/user.rb file and add the following codes in it  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class User &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base&lt;br /&gt;  acts_as_authentic &lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This is to add the Authlogic to the class, without which it will be just a standard model class.  Our next task is to create users controller. Also we require new and edit views, and hence we will make sure to create them through generators by the following command  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\user_authentication_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate controller users new edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Next we need to modify config/routes.rb file a bit and add the following line of code  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;map.resources :users  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Now inorder to display the link for "Register" , in all the pages of your application add the following lines in your app/views/layouts/application.html.erb file(If you dont have application.html.erb file, then create it)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div id="user_nav"&gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to "Register", new_user_path %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;lt;%= yield %&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Next add the following bunch of code in app/controllers/user_controller.rb  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class UsersController &amp;lt; ApplicationController&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; def new  &lt;br /&gt;  @user = User.new  &lt;br /&gt; end  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; def create  &lt;br /&gt;  @user = User.new(params[:user])  &lt;br /&gt;  if @user.save  &lt;br /&gt;   flash[:notice] = "Registration successful."  &lt;br /&gt;   redirect_to :controller=&amp;gt;"blog"  &lt;br /&gt;  else  &lt;br /&gt;   render :action =&amp;gt; 'new'  &lt;br /&gt;  end  &lt;br /&gt; end &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; def edit&lt;br /&gt; end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;We will be putting the code for registration in a partial as we will require it for registration as well as editing.  So create a patial file in app/views/users/_user.html.erb and add the following codes in it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;% form_for @user do |form| %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;%= form.error_messages %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol class="formList"&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.label :username, "Username" %&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.text_field :username %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.label :email, "Email" %&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.text_field :email %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.label :password, "Password" %&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.password_field :password %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.label :password_confirmation, "Password confirmation" %&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.password_field :password_confirmation %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.submit "Submit" %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;And then add the following code in the app/views/users/new.html.erb to call the partial for registration purpose  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;%= render @user %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Now if we check &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/blog"&gt;http://localhost:3000/blog&lt;/a&gt; we will see the "register" link and if we click on the link, we will be taken to the registration form. If we click on the register button without entering any details, we will get the validation errors and if we enter valid data and then register we will be redirected to blog page.  So far so good. next we will add a "Login" link next to "registration" link to let our users to login to the application. For this we have to create UserSession model to get the current status of our users. From the command line,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\user_authentication_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate session user_session&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This generator will create UserSession  model and this model will be just have an empty class.  Next we generate controller for the UserSession  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\user_authentication_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate controller UserSessions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;And add the following codes within the UserSessions Controller  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class UserSessionsController &amp;lt; ApplicationController&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; def new  &lt;br /&gt;   @user_session = UserSession.new  &lt;br /&gt; end  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; def create  &lt;br /&gt;   @user_session = UserSession.new(params[:user_session])  &lt;br /&gt;   if @user_session.save  &lt;br /&gt;     flash[:notice] = "Successfully logged in."  &lt;br /&gt;    redirect_to :controller=&amp;gt;"blog"  &lt;br /&gt;   else  &lt;br /&gt;     render :action =&amp;gt; 'new'  &lt;br /&gt;   end  &lt;br /&gt; end &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; def destroy  &lt;br /&gt;   @user_session = UserSession.find  &lt;br /&gt;   @user_session.destroy  &lt;br /&gt;   flash[:notice] = "Successfully logged out."  &lt;br /&gt;   redirect_to :controller=&amp;gt;"blog"   &lt;br /&gt; end &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Next create a view file in app/views/user_sessions/new.html.erb and add the following codes  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;% form_for @user_session do |form| %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;%= form.error_messages %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol class="formList"&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.label :username, "Username" %&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.text_field :username %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.label :password, "Password" %&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.password_field :password %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;         &amp;lt;%= form.submit "Submit" %&amp;gt;       &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;We will have to edit the config/routes.rb a bit to add the following codes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;map.login 'login', :controller =&amp;gt; 'user_sessions', :action =&amp;gt; 'new'  &lt;br /&gt;  map.logout 'logout', :controller =&amp;gt; 'user_sessions', :action =&amp;gt; 'destroy'  &lt;br /&gt;  map.resources :user_sessions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;We can also modify our application.rhtml file to add the link for login  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div id="user_nav"&gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to "Register", new_user_path %&amp;gt; | &lt;br /&gt;   &amp;lt;%= link_to "Log in", login_path %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Now if we check our blog page along with "Register" link we also ha "Login" link and if we click on "Login", we will be taken to a Login page with fields for username and password. Upon valid username and password entry, we will be taken to blog page with a flash message. On invalid login details, we will end up with validation errors.  Our next aim is to write code for logging out and display "Edit Profile" and "Logout" Links for the logged in users.  So let us modify the application.rhtml and have the following codes in there:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div id="user_nav"&gt;&amp;lt;% if current_user %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;     &amp;lt;%= link_to "Edit profile", edit_user_path(:current) %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;     &amp;lt;%= link_to "Logout", logout_path %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;   &amp;lt;% else %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;     &amp;lt;%= link_to "Register", new_user_path %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;     &amp;lt;%= link_to "Log in", login_path %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt;   &amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;lt;%= yield %&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;And also add the following code in the app/controllers/application_controller.rb   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class ApplicationController &amp;lt; ActionController::Base&lt;br /&gt;    helper_method :current_user  &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;    private  &lt;br /&gt;    def current_user_session  &lt;br /&gt;      return @current_user_session if defined?(@current_user_session)  &lt;br /&gt;      @current_user_session = UserSession.find  &lt;br /&gt;    end  &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;    def current_user  &lt;br /&gt;     @current_user = current_user_session &amp;amp;&amp;amp; current_user_session.record  &lt;br /&gt;   end  &lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;To make the "Edit profile" working modify the user_session controller to   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class UsersController &amp;lt; ApplicationController&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; def new  &lt;br /&gt;  @user = User.new  &lt;br /&gt; end  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; def create  &lt;br /&gt;  @user = User.new(params[:user])  &lt;br /&gt;  if @user.save  &lt;br /&gt;   flash[:notice] = "Registration successful."  &lt;br /&gt;   redirect_to :controller=&amp;gt;"blog"&lt;br /&gt;  else  &lt;br /&gt;   render :action =&amp;gt; 'new'  &lt;br /&gt;  end  &lt;br /&gt; end &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    def edit  &lt;br /&gt;      @user = current_user  &lt;br /&gt;    end  &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;    def update  &lt;br /&gt;      @user = current_user  &lt;br /&gt;      if @user.update_attributes(params[:user])  &lt;br /&gt;        flash[:notice] = "Successfully updated profile."  &lt;br /&gt;        redirect_to :controller=&amp;gt;"blog"  &lt;br /&gt;     else  &lt;br /&gt;       render :action =&amp;gt; 'edit'  &lt;br /&gt;     end  &lt;br /&gt;   end  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;And then we have to call the form partial by adding the following code within /app/views/users/edit.html.erb  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;%= render @user %&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats it. We are set to go with our application with this wonderfull gem/plugin for the user authentication functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-5080862847627146411?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2010/01/user-authentication-in-rails-authlogic.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/S0DIm8BkyDI/AAAAAAAAA2w/uDyc5QklQR4/s72-c/blog.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-5056479483426950657</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2009 04:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-14T10:48:35.103+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Prawnto</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Ruby</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Prawn</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Rails</category><title>Ruby on Rails PDF generator : Prawn gem &amp; Prawnto plugin</title><description>&lt;a href="http://github.com/techslam/pdf_demo" target="blank" style="color:#9D080D;font-weight:bold;"&gt;Download the pdf_demo application from GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been amazing working for a project using Ruby on rails framework. And with the awesome support from its community, the experience has been always smooth. In this post I will be introducing you with a wonderful gem/plugin for Rails to generate PDF's. Generating PDF's has never been this easy. When I was asked to generate PF reports in my current project, the hunt for the best plugin began and after testing a few plugins I came across a gem called 'prawn'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Prawn takes the pain out of generating beautiful printable documents, while still remaining fast, tiny and nimble."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Prawnto is a rails plugin which leverages the new prawn  library to produce compiled pdf views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this post , I will provide simple step by step instruction to install and configure prawn/prawnto and hence will be walking through a simple PDF generating demo application. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installing Prawn and Prawnto:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, we have to install prawn gem. From your command prompt(windows OS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;gem install prawn&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we have successfully installed prawn gem, we need to install Prawnto plugin. Before installing the plugin, lets create the demo application which will be using MySQL database..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the command prompt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\&amp;gt;rails pdf_demo -d mysql&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the project folder structure is created, move into the project folder:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\&amp;gt;cd pdf_demo&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now we will be installing the Prawnto plugin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\pdf_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/thorny-sun/prawnto.git/&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we have succesfully installed this plugin, we need to add the following line inside the environment.rb file of our project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;config.gem 'prawn'&lt;/pre&gt;within  "Rails::Initializer.run do |config|"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, lets go ahead and create the Controller named Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\pdf_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate controller Book&lt;br /&gt;      exists  app/controllers/&lt;br /&gt;      exists  app/helpers/&lt;br /&gt;      create  app/views/book&lt;br /&gt;      exists  test/functional/&lt;br /&gt;      create  test/unit/helpers/&lt;br /&gt;      create  app/controllers/book_controller.rb&lt;br /&gt;      create  test/functional/book_controller_test.rb&lt;br /&gt;      create  app/helpers/book_helper.rb&lt;br /&gt;      create  test/unit/helpers/book_helper_test.rb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next lets create the model named book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\pdf_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/generate model book&lt;br /&gt;      exists  app/models/&lt;br /&gt;      exists  test/unit/&lt;br /&gt;      exists  test/fixtures/&lt;br /&gt;      create  app/models/book.rb&lt;br /&gt;      create  test/unit/book_test.rb&lt;br /&gt;      create  test/fixtures/books.yml&lt;br /&gt;      create  db/migrate&lt;br /&gt;      create  db/migrate/20091211170948_create_books.rb&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our project contains one database table(books) with two columns namely name and author.So add the following code inside your migration file (20091211170948_create_books.rb)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class CreateBooks &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration&lt;br /&gt;  def self.up&lt;br /&gt;    create_table :books do |t|&lt;br /&gt;      t.string   :name&lt;br /&gt;      t.string   :author&lt;br /&gt;      t.timestamps&lt;br /&gt;    end&lt;br /&gt;  end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  def self.down&lt;br /&gt;    drop_table :books&lt;br /&gt;  end&lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we go further with any more code, if you open up your database.yml file, it says&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;development:&lt;br /&gt;  adapter: mysql&lt;br /&gt;  encoding: utf8&lt;br /&gt;  reconnect: false&lt;br /&gt;  database: pdf_demo_development&lt;br /&gt;  pool: 5&lt;br /&gt;  username: root&lt;br /&gt;  password:&lt;br /&gt;  host: localhost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we need to create "pdf_demo_development" named database. We can do that from the command prompt itself as shown below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\&amp;gt;mysql -u root&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I have assumed that the username is "root" and password is nil.&lt;br /&gt;If you have got password then use the following command&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\&amp;gt;mysql -u root -p (password)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get inside the mysql, we can go ahead and create the required database using following command&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mysql&amp;gt; CREATE DATABASE pdf_demo_development;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once this is successfull, we move ahead and migrate the database for our project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\pdf_demo&amp;gt;rake db:migrate&lt;br /&gt;(in C:/pdf_demo)&lt;br /&gt;==  CreateBooks: migrating ====================================================&lt;br /&gt;-- create_table(:books)&lt;br /&gt;   -&amp;gt; 0.0630s&lt;br /&gt;==  CreateBooks: migrated (0.0630s) ===========================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we will be adding some dummy data's into our newly created database table namely 'books'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the following command to add data to the table. First select the database from mysql using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mysql&amp;gt; use pdf_demo_development;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next lets add the dummy data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mysql&amp;gt; INSERT INTO books (name,author) VALUES ("The Rails Way", "Obie Fernandez");&lt;br /&gt;Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mysql&amp;gt; INSERT INTO books (name,author) VALUES ("Agile Web Development with Rails", "David");&lt;br /&gt;Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finally we write the codes for generating the PDF and showing the datas entered into the database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add the following codes into your app/controllers/book_controller.rb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class BookController &amp;lt; ApplicationController&lt;br /&gt; def index&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; end&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; def show&lt;br /&gt;  @book = Book.find(:all)&lt;br /&gt;  respond_to do |format|&lt;br /&gt;   format.pdf { render :layout =&amp;gt; false }&lt;br /&gt;  end   &lt;br /&gt; end&lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we have created a method called 'show' and created a variable called '@book' which contains all the record from the 'books' table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next lets create a view(.rhtml file) for the index method within the books folder and add the following line of code inside this file, which is just a link to generate the PDF file.&lt;br /&gt;app/views/book/index.rhtml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to "(PDF Report)", :controller=&amp;gt;"book", :action=&amp;gt;"show", :id=&amp;gt;"2", :format=&amp;gt;'pdf' %&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one final step before we run our server to view the result is to create a file with extension .pdf.prawn&lt;br /&gt;This is the file where we write the code to display the contents in the PDF file. So create a 'show.pdf.prawn' file and add the following code&lt;br /&gt;app/views/book/show.pdf.prawn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;pdf.move_down(30) &lt;br /&gt;books =  @book.map do |item|&lt;br /&gt; [&lt;br /&gt;  item.name,&lt;br /&gt;  item.author&lt;br /&gt; ]&lt;br /&gt;end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pdf.table books, :border_style =&amp;gt; :grid,&lt;br /&gt;     :row_colors =&amp;gt; ["FFFFFF", "DDDDDD"],&lt;br /&gt;     :headers =&amp;gt; ["book", "author"],&lt;br /&gt;     :align =&amp;gt; { 0 =&amp;gt; :left, 1 =&amp;gt; :right, 2 =&amp;gt; :right, 3 =&amp;gt; :right }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets go ahead and run the server&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;C:\pdf_demo&amp;gt;ruby script/server&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in your favorite browser go to =&amp;gt; http://localhost:3000/book/index&lt;br /&gt;and you will be taken to a page with your &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/book/index"&gt;(PDF report)&lt;/a&gt; link and on clicking on this link you can get your PDF report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SyMiTk4vTpI/AAAAAAAAA18/vb7lPmzmr3I/s1600-h/pdf_demo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="192" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SyMiTk4vTpI/AAAAAAAAA18/vb7lPmzmr3I/s400/pdf_demo.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You can visit &lt;a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/" target="blank"&gt;prawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cracklabs.com/prawnto" target="blank"&gt;prawnto&lt;/a&gt; websites to view their documentations and generate PDF's with various effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-5056479483426950657?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/12/ruby-on-rails-pdf-generator-prawn-gem.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SyMiTk4vTpI/AAAAAAAAA18/vb7lPmzmr3I/s72-c/pdf_demo.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>12</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-1141722678712145376</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2009 14:56:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-13T18:44:19.253+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>BrowserCMS</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Rails</category><title>BrowserCMS - RoR Content management System</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;These days I am busy learning new technical stuffs from Rails framework to wordpress developments. Recently I am engaged with a project which is related to Rails Content Management System. And among the various content management systems available for Rails framework, I am doing this project in &lt;a href="http://browsercms.org/" style="color: orange;"&gt;BrowserCMS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/Sx-6DaN-aVI/AAAAAAAAA14/8ewsuDfAdeI/s1600-h/BrowserCMS6.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/Sx-6DaN-aVI/AAAAAAAAA14/8ewsuDfAdeI/s400/BrowserCMS6.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Quoting the description about BrowserCMS's from their WiKi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BrowserCMS is a general purpose, open source Web Content Management System (CMS), written in Ruby on Rails. It is designed to support three distinct groups of people:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-technical web editors who want a humane system to manage their site, without needing to understand what HTML or even Rails is.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Designers who want to create large and elegantly designed websites with no artificial constraints by the CMS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developers who want create CMS driven websites for their clients, or add a CMS to their Rails applications.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The very first thing every developer would do is install the BrowserCMS system in their local server and once learn how to go about using it, then move on to installing the system over the server and deploy the application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The funny part is , In my case it all began in a reverse order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;We have got hosting account from &lt;a href="http://hostingrails.com/" style="color: orange;"&gt;HostingRails&lt;/a&gt;, where as our client has got hosting account from &lt;a href="http://webbynode.com/" style="color: orange;"&gt;WebbyNode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Initially we configured the BrowserCMS on HostingRails which worked fine as we were successfull in deploying the BrowserCMS demo site. Later on we did the same over WebbyNode and were successfull there too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As I wanted to work on this project on my local machine and later on deploy it over the server, I went ahead and tried installing it on my local server which was also a successful attempt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In upcoming days I will be posting step by step instructions, how I was able to install BrowserCMS over localhost in my computer and also various technical aspects on BrowserCMS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So if you are a rails developer and is interested about BrowserCMS, do get back to get more updates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-1141722678712145376?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/12/browsercms-ruby-on-rails-content.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/Sx-6DaN-aVI/AAAAAAAAA14/8ewsuDfAdeI/s72-c/BrowserCMS6.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-1641805618929449220</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2009 16:24:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-11T19:53:25.783+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Technical Post</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>ipod</category><title>iPod-Genius: October statistics</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/Su8BuLGN_II/AAAAAAAAA1U/c6Q-LuZqv-s/s1600-h/october+stats.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/Su8BuLGN_II/AAAAAAAAA1U/c6Q-LuZqv-s/s400/october+stats.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;October month was a high traffic month for &lt;a href="http://ipod-genius.blogspot.com/"&gt;iPod Genius blog&lt;/a&gt;.

I have been working on this amazing web application framework from June 2009. And its almost 5 months along with this framework and I am really enjoying it. Infact this is my first exposure towards a Web application framework and I am really happy to begin it with Rails. With rails you feel comfortable. It gives you the freedom to think out of the box. Being a newbie to this language and framework, there a lot of stuffs to learn and practice. Presently I am using Netbeans IDE for developing my project and Netbeans has never given any problems to me. It infact seems to be the best IDE for Rails with so much of support and help for Rails framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I will be keeping you guys updated about Rails with this blog. So do check back regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-8391817630544321953?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/10/working-with-ruby-on-rails.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SuB8xcDD99I/AAAAAAAAA1M/zyPkfNmcBiM/s72-c/rails_h90.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-3908737943038675217</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2009 15:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-11T19:57:03.278+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><title>Aslam's BlogBuzz: Best On Blogspot Contest</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LfKKhOaC4ks/SMFJAZZeGPI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/wx4c9s-kutw/S1600-R/Best-On-Blogger---Banner-1-938x100.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="44" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LfKKhOaC4ks/SMFJAZZeGPI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/wx4c9s-kutw/S1600-R/Best-On-Blogger---Banner-1-938x100.png" width="420" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I don't know how many of you might have heard of &lt;i style="background-color: #b6d7a8;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bestonblogspot.blogspot.com/"&gt;best-on-blogspot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; contest. Well let me tell you. This is a kind of contest run by blogspot blog to give recognition to other blogspot blogs.

After spending whole week with Ruby on Rails and Word-press theme design at office, Sunday has to be something innovative. I have been thinking to redesign my blog template for quite a few time. And finally it was today. Woke up bit too late and after the daily basic routine of breakfasts and other stuffs, I was in a complete good mood to give a new look to my blog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;My friends always used to make fun of my blog as it had hell a lot of colors and it was all shabby. But I loved my blog all the time. Why wouldn't I. It has won the best personal blog title twice from one of the blog contests and it earned me few dollars. Anyways it was today that I decided to give my blog a new look after one and half year long time. yes that does explain how busy I have been ;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Looking for some good and attractive free blog templates online, I finally found this particular template from &lt;a href="http://bloggertricks.com/"&gt;BloggerTricks.Com&lt;/a&gt; Template was cool, after checking it's demo, I decided this will be my new template at-least for some period of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In my previous blog template, I had installed&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/"&gt; Intense Debate&lt;/a&gt; commenting widget, and going ahead with this new template had the risk of getting rid of all my previous comments which was stored in IntenseDebate's server. But I had to take this risk to give a new look and feel for my blog. After the final installation, I had to make a lot of changes through this template. It had few problems which I had to fix manually. It did not have "Read More" option in the front page posts, so I had to write manual codes to get it fixed. Also top navigation bar was very dull, so worked on it to give some hover effects as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Well as of now everything seems to be fine with the template. I would be sticking with this template now. But I noticed one problem here, and that's whenever someone visits the blog for the first time in any browser, the browser asks them their twitter user-name and password. I think this has to be with the twitter updates widget installed in the template. I will be fixing this issue very soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Okay, what do you think about this new template of Aslam's BlogBuzz(Now Aslam'sBuzz)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Do you find any issue with this particular look, if so please let me know your views so that I can work on it to make it more and more better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So for now, CiaO ^_^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-7949663533148444013?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/10/aslams-blogbuzz-aslamsbuzz.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SsjX2g4S7FI/AAAAAAAAAyo/A8IGXtcA_R8/s72-c/scrnshot.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-4435608199122974283</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2009 14:53:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-11T19:57:20.252+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>ipod</category><title>iPOD Technical Support: September Analytics</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ipod-genius.blogspot.com/"&gt;FREE iPod Technical Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SsTBjz5ZDCI/AAAAAAAAAyY/sg_uJoVcJkc/s1600-h/ipod.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SsTBjz5ZDCI/AAAAAAAAAyY/sg_uJoVcJkc/s400/ipod.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Compared to August, there was a very large increase in the number of visits in September and majority of the visitors coming from the Search engines like Google and Yahoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-4435608199122974283?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/10/ipod-technical-support-september.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SsTBjz5ZDCI/AAAAAAAAAyY/sg_uJoVcJkc/s72-c/ipod.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-1775994693013777687</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2009 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-11T19:58:09.653+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>designs</category><title>Playing with PhotoShop 1</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Little threshold, little blending and here's what I ended up with a dancers image.

I hope many of you must have heard about this news. It was a sensational news in all forms of International media. If you have not heard about it, you just need to search it over the internet and you will find 1000's of news,discussions,videos about this incident. Click &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoXHXUu-6ow" target="blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to see the video in youtube.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;All over the world , politicians came infront and started condemning this incident, Pakistan government decided to start investigation on this issue. Lots of people came infront saying that, this video was a fake video and done by enemies of Taliban. All over the media worldwide, it was a headline questioning the Islamic Laws(Sharia), how barbarian a religion can go in the name of justice, what kind of cruel religion it is. Indeed you and me, who watch this video and the news in various international channel are forced to think how cruel the religion Islam is?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Well I have some comments to make on media. Here is one more news which I happen to see today in NDTV and Headline's Today news channels. Its about an Andhra women being beaten up in public and later on she dies in the hospital. Click &lt;a href="http://headlinestoday.intoday.in/index.php?option=com_registration&amp;amp;task=showprogramme&amp;amp;sectionid=87&amp;amp;secid=48&amp;amp;videoid=59616" target="blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to see the video and click &lt;a href="http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/andhra_womans_death_a_mothers_cry.php" target="blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to read the NDTV news on it.Similar kind of incident as of Taliban flogging a girl.Both the incident saying that these girls had affairs and their characters not being good.This incident occurred last month, and if I ask you or any other person about this incident , i dont think many would be knowing about this, Infact the Indian political leaders may not be knowing of this Andhra incident, leave apart International politicians. I tried searching for this news over the internet and to my surprise very less information about this incident which is far more barbarious than Taliban issue. Well i just went into some of the well known news websites of India, but other than one or two news media, other famous media's never covered this issue, or this issue just went unnoticed as a daily local news.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Now here is the question. Why was this serious incident which happens in India,the country which is having strong presence worldwide went unnoticed by indian politicians and Indian media, leave apart International media. Anyways few of the media which did show up this news, why was it headlined as "A Mother's Cry" or "A Mobs Punishment". Why the religion of the attackers were not  put under question here? Why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here is my view on this, Just because a powerful nation and its government along with its allies is against Islam and its rules, the whole of media turns against Islam and presents Islam as a religion of Terror(Though the fact is that Islam is a religion of Peace, Humanity and Mankind.). Ask any US or Europe citizen who is aware of international news, about the Taliban flogging issue, he will be able to explain how cruel the Taliban is and the Islamic law is. But if you ask him about the similar more barbarious incident that happens in India(Just like the one here about Andhra woman's death), he for most sure will not be aware of this. We cant blame him for that, as International media did not cover this issue as it has nothing to do with Islam or Islamic laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Why is this happening, why&amp;nbsp; Islam and its followers are being on target every now and then by the government of many nations and hence of the International media. Don't you think if this Andhra incident had happened in Pakistan or Afghanistan or say Iraq, then I say with full guarantee that it would have been the BREAKING NEWS in almost all International news channels and all around the world people condemning the attack and questioning Islam and its laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Crime is crime, no matter which part of the world it occurs. People behind these crimes must be punished be brought behind the judiciary, rather than pointing your fingers against a specific religion, for you have got no right to say a religion preaches terror as all religions stands for Peace, humanity, mankind , love etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;My request to all of you is, please wake up, understand how serious the situations are around you, how things are being put in-front of you and how you are made to hate a specific religion or a specific group. my request to all forms of media is go back to the basics of these religions and understand what they stand for, rather than just showing it down as terror group. Remember, by this you are hurting the faith of many out there. Stand for justice and not for those who are in powers. Remember, those who are in powers will never be in power forever, they will comedown as it is said in religious scriptures that, &lt;i&gt;truth will prevail and falsehood is born to perish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #b6d7a8;"&gt;Share it with me your views on issues of this kind and the reaction of International media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-7909116123421650131?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/09/biased-international-media.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-8634439727194880198</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2009 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-13T18:54:02.877+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Fun</category><title>ATM  Transaction... How Strange !</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Here is the deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I have two savings bank account from banks namely &lt;b style="background-color: #f4cccc;"&gt;Sity Bank&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b style="background-color: #f4cccc;"&gt;Exis Bank&lt;/b&gt;. I had 10,000 bucks in my Exis Bank account and just Rs.4 in my Sity Bank account. Near my locality I did not have any ATM, either of these banks, but I found out an ATM of yet another bank named &lt;b style="background-color: #f4cccc;"&gt;Onion Bank&lt;/b&gt;. Well, I wanted to withdraw the entire 10,000 bucks from my Exis bank account for some need. So I decided to walk into Onion bank ATM. I took out my ATM card from my purse, swiped it through the ATM of Onion bank  and when it prompted me to enter the password, I entered the password. Password got&amp;nbsp; accepted&amp;nbsp; and then I enter the amout for withdrawal and then after sometime, i get a message of failed transaction. I tried it for 3 to 4 times, still the same error, TRANSACTION FAILED !. I thought that Onion bank ATM does not accept my card for some reason and I walked out of the ATM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On the way back to my home, I just had a strange feeling for what might be the reason for transaction failure for no specific reason. Later I realized. Did I tell you, which ATM card I used to swipe through the Onion Bank ATM? I guess no. Well to my stuppidness I used the Sity bank ATM card which just had Rs.4 in it. How dumb I am. You must be agreeing to the fact that, yea I how dumb I am&amp;nbsp; for I tried to withdraw 10,000 from an account which just had Rs.4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SpvtQnE9-pI/AAAAAAAAAxc/Cwk7XDQNaAg/s1600-h/atm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SpvtQnE9-pI/AAAAAAAAAxc/Cwk7XDQNaAg/s320/atm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;That did not stop me from thinking deeply into that on the way back home. I cant be that dumb, I might have accidentally picked up Sity bank ATM card from my purse. Accidentally picked up my Sity bank card thinking it is Exis bank ATM card...hey hey..that means to withdraw money I must have used the Exis bank password right. Yes, I remember , I used Exis bank password on a wrong&amp;nbsp; ATM card. But then how the hell did the password work out on Sity bank ATM card and provided me with my bank details. This question is still killing me. Is something wrong with the Sity bank ATM system that on its card any random password just worked out. Oh crap this is very bad indeed, or is it something else, if it is what is it??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Have you ever been in this kind of situation or would like to share with me your ATM funny experince, just leave me a comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Have a good day :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-8634439727194880198?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/08/atm-transaction-how-strange.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SpvtQnE9-pI/AAAAAAAAAxc/Cwk7XDQNaAg/s72-c/atm.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-4620717734339232737</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2009 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-11T19:58:39.861+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Technical Post</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>ipod</category><title>iPod Technical Support</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ipod-genius.blogspot.com/"&gt;iPod Technical Support&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; is my yet another blog where I write about iPod troubleshooting steps. Mostly i write to the questions posted by my visitors. I started this blog at around mid of April. After starting this blog I never wrote any article. Actually I was thinking whats the use of this particular blog. later in the month of June I saw a comment in that blog from an iPod user and she was requesting a help. I was very much surprised thinking, how come a person comment on a blog which had any article or posts about iPod. I replied to that comment by writing a neat article on how that particular issue can be fixed. I think it was around July end that I must have written that post and one of my friend suggested to make use of Google Analytic to get the accurate stats of the blog. So on July 29th I decided to install Google analytic and from then on there was no looking back. I am very proud to say that 80% of my visitors come from various search engines. and I get many requests through comments and through personal emails to help on various iPod issues. Though I give help for FREE, i decided why not I include a PAYPAL DONATE button so that in-case any visitor is really happy about my help, he can donate me and I did not have to wait too long that one of my visitor was so happy with my help that he donated me some dollars and I was really happy for this achievement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;This is my one month Google Analytic statistics:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SppNDTwwSuI/AAAAAAAAAxU/MWaJH-DiY-o/s1600-h/Untitled-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SppNDTwwSuI/AAAAAAAAAxU/MWaJH-DiY-o/s400/Untitled-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-4620717734339232737?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/08/ipod-technical-support.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SppNDTwwSuI/AAAAAAAAAxU/MWaJH-DiY-o/s72-c/Untitled-1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-268103488303563984</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2009 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-12-11T20:02:44.691+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>designs</category><title>My Attempt To Design a Website Using Photoshop</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Hi Friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Working as an internet engineer for a design company, I see talented designers around me design some wonderful designs for our clients. The logos, websites designed by our designers are always eye catchy and to the mark. As a programmer I just appreciate the way they design stuff's and have a strong desire to learn Photoshop and design something of my own. I know, you cannot learn something overnight, but I thought I will give it a shot and I came up with a website layout. I designed this layout keeping in mind my one other blog named &lt;a href="http://ipod-genius.blogspot.com/"&gt;iPod-Genius&lt;/a&gt;. So let me know through your comments, hows my very first attempt of design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Click on the Image to see the enlarged view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SpFLmOZXuWI/AAAAAAAAAw8/QQUMJ03ZTpA/s1600-h/2_design+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SpFLmOZXuWI/AAAAAAAAAw8/QQUMJ03ZTpA/s400/2_design+copy.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-268103488303563984?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-attempt-to-design-website-using.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SpFLmOZXuWI/AAAAAAAAAw8/QQUMJ03ZTpA/s72-c/2_design+copy.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-6454623232138335169</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2009 15:14:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-08-18T20:44:25.229+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Technical Post</category><title>Adobe Auto Updates.... I Hate Them :x</title><description>Hi Friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must be thinking, why should I hate automatic updates from Adobe. Infact I would hate all kind of automatics updates which happen over the internet. The only reason behind this is my bandwidth limit provided to me by my ISP. It is just 1.5GB per month. That means per day 50MB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now most of the applications does allow us to prevent the automatic updates by changing it in their settings. But I never found any settings to stop Adobe automatic updates for all adobe applications. Finally I found the hidden trick to kill Adobe automatic updates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the step by step instructions below and you too can get rid of adobe auto updates.(Only for Windows OS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/3427/adobereaderlite.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/3427/adobereaderlite.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Open the C drive, Go to Program files, Open Common Files folder,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.There you find Adobe folder, open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.There you find Updater5 folder, open that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Double click on AdobeUpdater.exe, it will check for available updates, then after that you will find preferences option, There you find a check box to cancel auto updates. Just cancel it and click OK. You are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I can save some of my bandwidths. Yeahooooo :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-6454623232138335169?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/08/adobe-auto-updates-i-hate-them-x.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-1578342650721269302</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2009 04:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-07-31T10:19:12.311+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>gallery</category><title>BMW M1 Pictures</title><description>&lt;b&gt;Click On The Images To View Enlarged Images...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2rQCTcqI/AAAAAAAAAuA/i0X4iNnJJzw/s1600-h/image001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2rQCTcqI/AAAAAAAAAuA/i0X4iNnJJzw/s400/image001.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2xMMT-pI/AAAAAAAAAuI/038VulXc1eI/s1600-h/image002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2xMMT-pI/AAAAAAAAAuI/038VulXc1eI/s400/image002.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ21_PDQsI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/r9IASFlOoxE/s1600-h/image003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ21_PDQsI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/r9IASFlOoxE/s400/image003.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ26XQgwfI/AAAAAAAAAuY/_lNCWhCS0us/s1600-h/image004.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ26XQgwfI/AAAAAAAAAuY/_lNCWhCS0us/s400/image004.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2_nvoJDI/AAAAAAAAAug/zFh5Dexbl8M/s1600-h/image005.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2_nvoJDI/AAAAAAAAAug/zFh5Dexbl8M/s400/image005.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ3E5YNMeI/AAAAAAAAAuo/mtRC9AFGJro/s1600-h/image006.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ3E5YNMeI/AAAAAAAAAuo/mtRC9AFGJro/s400/image006.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-1578342650721269302?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/07/bmw-m1-pictures.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2RdcFsdvQws/SnJ2rQCTcqI/AAAAAAAAAuA/i0X4iNnJJzw/s72-c/image001.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-6426375269533063473</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2009 16:27:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-07-28T22:03:41.713+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>story</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Career</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>professional life</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Entertainment</category><title>230 NIGHTS @ THE CALL CENTER - 2</title><description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/07/230-nights-call-center-1.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to read from the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;&lt;b style="background-color: #ffe599;"&gt;The Three Months With&amp;nbsp; A New Team&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;Departed from the training team with whome i was living wonderful days of my life, it was pretty tough for me to accept that I have to be in a new team of nearly 15 members. All the faces were new. Few faces were the one which I used to watch during the traing days :P, so they did not seems to be that new though they seemed to be strangers in all aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Team Leader Nancy.. A young lady in her mid twenties. With huge smile on her face all the time. Thus there begun new chapter of introductions all over again. I just hated this part, where we have to ask names,natives. Huh....But I loved when others asked me all these.. .My team had one of the cutest girl, her name was Monica, Everyone in the office had an eye on her.Did I mention earlier that, there were few faces which I used to watch during training days, well this face mite be the one.lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alrite, so days with new team were just going on. Initially we were not allowed to take any calls. Floor supervisors were giving us training on how to be professionals on the call, how to handle customers, how to solve certain issue. Well all these were pretty much useful to us as the trainer really sucked during training days. They never gave us proper training. Who the hell made them as Trainers, must be some part of politics within the company responsible for these useless people to get into these posts. No wonder why they played politics in final evaluations, Politics was running in their blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Few of the Floor supervisor were really good at training us with basic necessity of call handling procedures and few just tried to flirt around with the young ladies in the team.As the days passed by, I started getting friendly with most of the team members and the Team leader Nancy...She was the best. We all liked her very much in a short period of time. Her character  and the way she interacted with evryone, no wonder why most of them liked her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the good show in the training provided by floor supervisors and the team leader, few from my team including me was chosen to start taking calls. I was really nervous when I first took the call. I am not used to these American Accent. How am I gonna understand what they are saying and what will happen if i am not able to handle the customer well. All these thoughts was making me feel dizzy. But there was no looking back. I had the confidence that, if i collect some courage and handle few calls, i can then manage well. In my first few calls, some experienced representatives sat beside me to walk me through certain call handling procedures and that really helped to gain the confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After few days call handling, i was being somewhat comfortable and I was having a good impression within my team. I loved it. My happiness did not stay longer, when one night, my team leader approached me and said that, One of the customer had sent a survey on my name and her remark was that, She was not happy with me and I did not resolve her Issue. I was getting depressed. Tension could be seen through me. But Nancy patted me on my back and told that, that paricular call was handled well by me(she had recorderd the call and listened to it), Customer was not satisfied due to some other reason. Nancy talked to me for nearly half hour consoling me and telling me that I was the best and I could do well in coming days. Her words were so encouraging  and I promised her that I will gfive my best shot in each and every call and would not let her and the team down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very soon all of my team members began taking calls and sitting in a bay we all enjoyed a lot along with Nancy. We would play pranks with each other, Go for short breaks all together. It was really fun all throughout. The entire 15 members of the team were like a single gang out there&amp;nbsp; and there were other teams too in the floor and there used to be cat-dog race between different teams taking team performance on account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a team Leader named Nathan and his team was equally good like us. Our team and his team used to sit next to each other and used to have a cold war all the time based on the performance.We had to agree to the fact that Nathan's team had some good performers because of which some weeks they topped the Team stats and some weeks we managed to get above them. All in all there were many teams competing with each other, but beating Nathan's Team gave us more satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, The guys who were moved to the premanent posts were having tough time out there as their team Leader screwed them all the time(As told by some of my old training friends). That was really pleasing to hear after what has happened at the end of the training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month we came to know that, most of the guys from temporary posts will be kicked out based on the performance and only few will be made permanent. And till date what we have seen over here. We were pretty much sure that, no performance will be the factor. Just wish you were a girl, you would make it in there.Lolzz..After this news , everyone felt the heat and tension could be seen on every faces. I was also nervous though my performance never went down. But here anything can happen. I could also feel that My team was getting the heat in a pretty different way. I could see a line being drawn in between the team. Untill now, there was no groupism within our Team which we were very proud of, but after this news everything changed. There was no team spirit. Everyone just had only one thought. Just make it to the top so that Managers can never ignore you while preparing the final list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All enjoyment was dried out. But the group in which I was a part, we still had a great time with each other.We wanted to live every moment of our days in the company. We had a slogan within us and that was "BUSINESS ROCKS". This slogan just added flavour to our bondings. Well if you ask what does that slogan Mean.. Well Just forget It.. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could see that, other part of my team were trying to impress Team Leaders and other Supervisors to the max so that they be considered during final listing. Well not to blame them, They have seen the politics happen at the end of the training days and they are just trying to survive here. But we did not try anything. We just performed to our level and waited things to happen in its own way. During those days Our team also planned a one night trip to some tourist place. Had a great time. There were very emotional moments during this trip. We had to talk on each others character. All in all it was a hell of a trip and it would be remebered by each and everyone of us forver, though there was indifferences between each other during these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the trip, within few days, shorlisting of candidates begun and few of the team mates were kicked out in no time. Actually this was not only with my team..every team was going through this phase. Few days later I was called into a meeting. When I moved into the meeting room, I could see some of the process managers and many other like me in the room. Once everyone who were asked to come for meeting had arrived, the meeting begun.It was said in the meeting that those who are present in the meeting will be made permanent from next month. I was surprised. A bit happy for my own selection, but sad a lot because this selection means, the  rest of my best buddies will be kicked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very soon the news was out. It was also said that one more shortlisting will be done to move some more into the permanent position. Most of my best buddies had to meet the HR's on the same day and they were told to submit their ID cards. That day was supposed to be the last day with my team as from the next day, new team will be made for those who were made permanent. We could see the sadness in the face of most of the guys. My team had some of the best technical representatives. My stats were good. So my chances were high to move into permanent position. But apart from me there was a girl from my team who too&amp;nbsp; was moved into permanent position. That even shocked my team leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was no were near to the level of professionalism and performance showed by some of the other representatives.No questions were asked. We knew some bad politics went unnoticed behind the scene. Nothing could be done. Had to accept it and move on. When the next shortlisting was done, my other best buddy named Abhay got through it. I was really happy knowing this. I have someone with me from the old buddy list. The thrill to work was gone after the resignation of all other best buddies of mine. &lt;br /&gt;But somewere I expected that much more BPO sutras are still left to be explored, and I did explore it in the rest of my journey in this field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="background-color: #ffe599; color: #cc0000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Last Three Months With&amp;nbsp; Yet Another Team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Check back to Read what happens with Me in this new team....&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Will Be Continued...)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-6426375269533063473?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/07/230-nights-call-center-2.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-8315777050028249568</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2009 13:05:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-07-28T22:01:08.489+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>college life</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>story</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Career</category><title>230 NIGHTS @ THE CALL CENTER - 1</title><description>Well actually i was planning to write down something here since a long time. But the life after graduation. OMG.. Its driving me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways am here back with something to share with you all.&lt;br /&gt;Okay. You must be thinking What the "F" is the title of this post all about. Well, those who knows me well must have guessed it right what am I gonna share with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infact most of you might have read the novel from Chetan Bhagat titled&lt;b&gt; "One night @ the Call Center"&lt;/b&gt;. Well I am not gonna bore you with any of my stories here.Lol&lt;br /&gt;Here I want to share with you all some precious moments of my life, actually 230 days of my life at the city of garden, Bangalore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was here in search of a job. Well when I say about the job, I remember about the three Job offers which I had received when I was doing my graduations, but none of the three MNC dared to take a peek into the lifes of these graduated freshers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, let me not divert from the fact that I am here to share something about those 230 nights. Okay, Now that you have read so far, and had a good look into the title of this post, I needn't mention what was the job I finally landed into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who are getting bored by the stuff over here, Please just get the hell out of here.Just Kidding. Its your time.Why should I be bothered of your time.Wohaaaah... Okay back to track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="background-color: #ffe599; color: #cc0000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Month Of Training:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really exited about this job, Though this was not the right kind of job I must be doing.Anyways job is a job untill they pay me for what I am doing.&amp;nbsp;Well, The first day was pretty cool. My training team was great. trainer too was great. I was loving this place.Did I mention that i was a graduate fresher.Well okay, I am a graduate fresher and this was my first professional exposure. So I was just enjoying pretty much in all ways.&lt;br /&gt;Days of training were going incredibly great,Why shouldnt it be. The Client to which we are supposed to work after the one month of training was a huge name in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had few tests based on the training. Some were exceptionally good that they topped the tests in all means.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that this company is a call center. yea.. the final test which we trainees had to undergo was MOCK CALLs, where we trainees had to attend the calls of some other trainers and the calls would be monitered by some other trainers and finally all these trainers would evaluate each trainee based on his performance.. few of my team members were having a charming faces as they had done exceptionally well..and few had dull faces, for the reason that you must have guessed it right.My face expressions were pretty much fifty fifty kind of.Lol. And these dull faces were of those charming girls who were supposed to be always charming being the fact that they are always charming. Hahaha..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But surprise surprise.... The Dull faces turns out to be charming and few charming faces turns out to be dull. You know why.. haha...the results are out and it seems like the great trainers liked the charming faces of girls  so much that performances were not looked into but the charmness and the butteryness of few others were the basis of test evaluations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the begining of so called politics in a professional world. We had to accept it. We have to move on. Well the one with the charming faces and buttery character were straightly moved into the respective positions and made permanent employees. And the rest of them were put into a temporary positions for three months.What about me? I am not a girl with the charm and ya...i dont have buttery soapy words flowing out of me for my trainers, so I am in the Temporary post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="background-color: #ffe599; color: #cc0000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Three Months With&amp;nbsp; A New Team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/07/230-nights-call-center-2.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to read the second part.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-8315777050028249568?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/07/230-nights-call-center-1.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-8536127181849878701</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2009 11:21:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-07-28T21:58:25.228+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Career</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>professional life</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>satyam computers</category><title>Back Online !</title><description>Hi Friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;As promised am here, back to the world of blogging.I know most of you might have had a thought in their minds that I might not return.But I had to.Its been eight plus months I have been away from the Blogging.I had given the reason for the same in my previous posts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Working as Technical support representative for US Process, I was so busy with the Bangalore night life that I never got time to turn around to se whats happening arond.Yea, A lot of things has happened.Satyam Computer, the firm in which I was placed is no more.Unfortunates happened with this company and thus unfortunates happened with most of the Satyam freshers of 2008.Am one among them.Hopes are high for the bright future.Never get dejected.Be calm and composed on every aspects of life.If you are destined for success, then no one can stop you from acheiving it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wish all the 2008 freshers who are hit by the current recession, GOOD LUCK.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-8536127181849878701?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/05/back-online.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8909909721459519453.post-2355212960342599543</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2009 05:50:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-01-12T11:25:17.464+05:30</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Personal Bliss</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Career</category><title>MESSAGE FROM ASLAM</title><description>Hi Friends&lt;br /&gt;I am really sorry for not posting here for such a long time.Reasons are obvious.From my previous post you must have guessed what kept me so long from posting here.Anyways life's hectic.Am here at Bangalore.Working in one of the prestigious BPO.Though its a prestigious organization,feels not that good as this is not what i am supposed to do.Anyways hopes are high.Hopes from Satyam Computers are dead.But life will give me a second chance to bounce back.pray for me.&lt;br /&gt;Will be back with full flow to the world of blogging.untill then Good Bye&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL MY READRES AND FRIENDS&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8909909721459519453-2355212960342599543?l=aslam-revised.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://aslam-revised.blogspot.com/2009/01/message-from-aslam.html</link><author>aslam9895@gmail.com (TechSlam)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
