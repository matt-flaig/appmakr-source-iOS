It was a good experience building these apps knowing to get the Android phone better - the Conclusion - I still love iPhone. Maybe one day I will change my opinion about Android Phones that is when they come up with a cool phone - but for now my vote goes to iPhone and I would continue making apps for both of them and maybe other devices in future.&lt;br /&gt;

An interesting post on how someone wanted to develop free, open source apps for the Palm platform and ran into all kinds of issues with the process.&lt;br /&gt;

An interesting post on how someone wanted to develop free, open source apps for the Palm platform and ran into all kinds of issues with the process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A few days after the Palm Pre was released, I wrote a couple of programs for it: a restaurant Tip Calculator, and a port of Dali Clock. These were, as far as I&#039;m aware, the 2nd and 3rd third-party applications for Palm WebOS that were ever available. I got on this boat early.
So why are they still not available in Palm&#039;s App Catalog? That&#039;s a very good question. This is my story about attempting to simply distribute this free software that I have written, and how Palm has so far completely prevented me from doing so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;                    </content>

* General Discussion&lt;br /&gt;
o You can translate the film into episode, but it might be too slow paced.&lt;br /&gt;
o â€œApisodesâ€ â€“ making fun of episodes&lt;br /&gt;
+ Donâ€™t give away the whole movie.&lt;br /&gt;
+ Just give a glimpse of the film&lt;br /&gt;
+ Streaming&lt;br /&gt;
+ Downloading&lt;br /&gt;
+ Episodes&lt;br /&gt;
+ TV&lt;br /&gt;
+ iPhon3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* I only watch TV of Â½ hour or 1 hour at a time. I got restless during the film.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* The film had good content&lt;br /&gt;
o Made you think about yourself, and how others view you&lt;br /&gt;
* Donâ€™t like it on the iPhone. I just want it on the iPhone if it was only 20 or 30 minutes long&lt;br /&gt;
* Allow viewers to download all different forms of the film&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Use regular distribution methods, but use disruption to generate higher revenue&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* iPhone developers want to help films that are smaller and break away from the Hollywood model&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Use disruptive model&lt;br /&gt;
* Use all mediums like Dr. Horrible&lt;br /&gt;
* People like disruptive media because it is not how it currently being done&lt;br /&gt;
o Breaks the mold allows for viewers to participate in the marketing and distribution of the film&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Hollywood does not see any revenue gains in disruptive media&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Fundamental question of what are we trying to do with this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;br /&gt;
o Make money?&lt;br /&gt;
o Create community to fund next film?&lt;br /&gt;
o Disrupt Hollywood?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Distribution Discussion&lt;br /&gt;
o Distribute trailer through mobile stores&lt;br /&gt;
o Segment the film into smaller pieces so it would work better on mobile devices.&lt;br /&gt;
+ Another way to get your content out&lt;br /&gt;
+ Makes it more democratic&lt;br /&gt;
+ Episodes break the feature film format&lt;br /&gt;
+ The film is a little too long and should not be broken up into episodes&lt;br /&gt;
+ Show the film in a streaming format rather then download&lt;br /&gt;
# ievents (Hulu)&lt;br /&gt;
# Streaming could be too slow as wireless carriers will not allow streaming over 3g at this time so Wi-Fi is only current option&lt;br /&gt;
# Broadcast the film through channels (QUALCOMM)&lt;br /&gt;
* Turns cell service into bandwidth&lt;br /&gt;
* FCC regulations allow for better streaming with this new megawith&lt;br /&gt;

# Distribute through the iTunes store as an independent filmmaker&lt;br /&gt;
# Disruptive idea&lt;br /&gt;
* Use the method that Nine Inch Nails and Radio Head used&lt;br /&gt;
o Pay for the film directly through the filmâ€™s website&lt;br /&gt;
o Use a cloud system for downloading&lt;br /&gt;

+ Use extra footage shot with handheld camera such as commentaries and interviews with actors while the film was being made as additional option that people can buy on Hulu if they liked the film and want to learn more&lt;br /&gt;
# Like a directors cut&lt;br /&gt;
# Some people may just purchase it without seeing the movie because they like directors cuts and not the actual film&lt;br /&gt;
* How to swim with the sharks without being eaten alive&lt;br /&gt;
# Build a community that stretches the content&lt;br /&gt;

In this article on Mac|Life, Kevin Duerr talks about how his GoogleVoice app was pulled from the App Store. Some choice quotes:&lt;blockquote&gt;â€œApple made it impossible for our customers to receive the fixes, updates, and support by pulling the app. We were fulfilling our end of the bargain.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;â€œWe are interested in both the Android and WebOS (Pre) platforms. But at this moment, we have not made any final decisions at all, other than that it would be really hard to continue to invest our own dollars in the iPhone development program for our own apps. We think that we will continue to develop apps for our clients but will strongly caution them that they too could lose their investment if Apple ever decides to pull their app.â€&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If you cant move, your opponent gets to move again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When both you and your opponent cannot play another piece, or if every square on the board is filled, the game is over. You count up the number of black pieces and the number of white pieces and the winner is the one with the most pieces. (The iphone counts for you automatically.)&lt;br /&gt;

MobileMe costs $99/year and has taken time to perfect while subscribers have had to hang on waiting for the value. Just as Apple is getting it right, free services such as Ovi, Google, and soon to be many others are offering similar services. MobileMe does have features that allow ones iPhone, home computer and cloud based MobileMe location to do some pretty neat tricks, but the novelty will soon wear off as third party apps match or surpass them, all while finding better models for monetization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What Nokia is doing is smart. As a device manufacturer they realize the importance of moving into the applications and services market. Devices with plenty of horsepower will soon be a commodity, but the relationship with the consumer will never be. Cloud based services are nascent and where the value ends up residing will be interesting to follow. Apple would do well to follow Nokia&#039;s lead making MobileMe free (or close to it) and figure out how to monetize the relationship in a better way. Until then it&#039;s hard to justify the $99.&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/nIQF*5G17X85-ac0TbTNmSpqLgFDidIeDoNgrJ*TBcPd7Z1WXwQ0Rz*GPqJypxl9GU9w3iyX5jaPqCFrnIaokF60dSHM83Ap/ovistore.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;402&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </content>
