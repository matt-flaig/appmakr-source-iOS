      <![CDATA[><a href="http://www.r2integrated.com/AboutR2i/R2iOverview.aspx">R2Integrated</a> of Baltimore released their own mobile marketing survey last week, which signaled that marketers will play it a little conservatively in the space in the coming year. Basically, it seems, marketers still need to teach themselves how to best take advantage of the different tools mobile marketing has to offer. Afterall, it's a new way to reach people who are usually on the move -- which is different than marketing campaigns devised for TV and even the desktop Web.
 
“It appears that 2010 will be a year of experimentation and education on mobile marketing as marketers struggle to come to terms with its practicality and ROI,” said Matt Goddard, co-founder and CEO of R2I, said in a statement.  “This shouldn’t suggest that marketers ought to table their mobile marketing plans, but that they should pay considerable attention to how they can connect the dots back to driving revenue.”
 
Below is a summary of the survey, for your perusal:

      <![CDATA[><p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/ipad">Apple iPad</a> could be huge for the nascent mobile advertising market -- now advertisers can expect to have ads that display in tens of thousands of iPhone apps displayed on a new portable device. And, it appears Apple has positioned itself to take full advantage of the growing industry with <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/28/apple-quattro-wireless-ipad/">its recent purchase of Quattro Wireless</a>.  <img hspace="4" height="199" border="0" align="left" width="177" vspace="2" title="paulpalmieri.jpg" alt="paulpalmieri.jpg" src="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/technology/paulpalmieri.jpg" /></p><p>Another big mobile ad company, based here in Baltimore, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.millennialmedia.com">Millennial Media</a>, is also bullish on the iPad's prospects for mobile advertising. Paul Palmieri, Millennial's co-founder and CEO (left), shares his thoughts below:   </p><p>As the CEO of the leading independent mobile advertising network and technology provider, I am excited about the opportunity to extend our market-leading advertising solution to the new iPad ecosystem of application developers, publishers and advertisers.&nbsp;  </p><p>I wanted to share a few of my initial thoughts on the iPad after yesterday&rsquo;s announcement:     </p><p>The iPad is a <strong>big mobile device, <u>not</u> a stripped down PC</strong>.   This isn&rsquo;t a surprise to us. We have been predicting for years that tablet devices would ultimately be based on mobile platforms.  Why?  I see a couple of reasons for this:  </p><p>*  First, the mobile experience is inherently different from the desktop experience.  Devices and applications (and ad networks) built from the ground up to serve mobile users deliver a far superior experience.  Trying to cram the wired web into smaller, mobile devices just doesn&rsquo;t work for mobile consumers.    <img hspace="4" height="102" border="0" align="right" width="183" vspace="2" title="millennial-media.gif" alt="millennial-media.gif" src="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/technology/millennial-media.gif" /></p><p>*  The other primary reason is that mobile users are more willing to pay for content and are much more responsive to advertising (if done correctly) than web surfers on the wired web. Publishers and application developers see the potential of extending the smart phone ecosystem of pay and advertising- supported applications and mobile web-based content to a new category of device that is from its inception, inherently mobile.&nbsp;</p>]]>
      <![CDATA[><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*  The price is right. I was excited and a little surprised to see an entry price point of $499 for the device. I was even more excited to see $29.99 unlimited data plans, with no contract, and that it was only an additional $130 for 3G support.  Clearly, there are different levels of pricing to appeal to specific user demands for speed and storage capabilities.  This shows that, from the start, Apple sees the iPad as a mainstream, mass-market device.   The unlocked, non-contract 3G support (free use of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s hotspots is another great addition) is healthy for the industry and good for consumers.     </p><p>*  Applications are more important than ever.  Millennial Media supports a large ecosystem of application developers across numerous mobile platforms.   Each application developer in our network that I have spoken with, from the largest media companies to the independent developer, has been incredibly excited about extending his or her applications to this new class of device.     </p><p>*  The palate for mobile advertisers has just been expanded.   We have spent a good deal of time over the past year helping our advertising partners best use emerging mobile platforms, like the iPhone, Android and Blackberry platforms, to reach mobile consumers in new and exciting ways.   </p><p>With the iPad and numerous other tablet devices poised to reach the market early in 2010, we are excited to work with advertisers to help them get the most out of this new class of mobile device.   *  The monetization roadmap for developers increasingly needs to be a coordinated business strategy.  </p><p>New screens, new platforms and new opportunities mean complexity for developers.  Developers should partner with providers who give them broad device and opportunity coverage in a coordinated fashion, and that have direct relationships with the advertisers who seek these new and powerful audiences.  </p><p>Mobile applications are a rich and growing market, and being tied to a single operating system or set of devices can have a limiting effect (reach and financial).  Feel free to check out the richest set of developer tools and revenue available today at <a href="http://developer.millennialmedia.com">http://developer.millennialmedia.com</a>.   </p><p>Those are my initial thoughts. You will be hearing a lot more about the iPad from Millennial Media in the coming weeks. -- <em>Paul Palmieri</em> </p>]]>

      <![CDATA[><img alt="iPadProsCons.jpg" src="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/technology/iPadProsCons.jpg" width="550" height="733" /> 
 
As <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/technology/bal-bz.ipad28jan28,0,5120135.story">I reported</a> (along with <a href="http://www.google.com/news/search?aq=f&pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&q=apple+ipad">the rest of the techy and general media</a>), Apple Inc. introduced the highly anticipated iPad tablet computer yesterday.
 
In general, I think, it was about what people had come to expect after months of speculation. As always, I expect Apple to add more bells and whistles to the thing -- and drop prices -- in six to 12 months. I might be a relatively early adopter, but I'm not bleeding edge, preferring to mull over a tech purchase and consider closely my own use patterns and needs. 
 
That said, I sketched out some preliminary pros and cons of the iPad, as I perceive them. <strong>What am I missing?</strong> Of course, there's a little irony that I used a cheap Office Max yellow-lined pad in my analysis of a $500 pad-like machine.  (Here are <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/">Apple's official tech specs</a> for the iPad.)
 
The way I see it, if Apple managed to eliminate just two of my cons -- I'd say any two -- I'd feel more excited about the iPad. Til then, it's entered "wait, see and touch" land in my thinking -- which means many more future visits to the local Apple Store. <em>(Aside to wife: Sorry, honey.)</em> 
 
That said, I think natural customers of this device will be iPhone and iTouch users, as well as those looking for netbooks to use primarily as a Web browsing device. I think that if most iPhone and Touch users are honest with themselves, they use these gadgets to do a LOT of Web surfing and content consumption -- and they may unconsciously be pining for more screen real estate to do these tasks on. 
 
The iPad may not be an instant success, but I think the new category that Apple is taking a gamble on is here to stay. ]]>

IF a tablet is announced today, here are some questions I'll have about it:
 
* How much will it cost?
* How does it interact with existing iPhone apps? (And does it run a version of the iPhone operating system?)
* What kind of e-book experience does it offer?
* What kind of gaming experience does it offer?
* Does it do live video-conferencing?
* How will the iTunes store change to accommodate it?
 
What other questions do you have about the device? Drop a note below.
<br /> 
 
Live blog updates:
 
1:00 pm... Huge applause

1:05pm Jobs: Apple, by revenue is the largest mobile device maker in the world... (when you talk about mobile/portable in total)
1:06: Now let's get to the main event (jobs teasing the crowd... instead, takes crowd back to 1991 and the first powerbook, as the first modern laptop computer)
1:07 Is there room for another category of devices? Of course we thought of this question for years as well (brief outage
1:09: third category of device have to be better at gaming, e-media than a laptop or a smart phone... some people say 'that's a netbook.' the problem is that netbooks aren't better at anything... they're just cheap laptops. (big laughs)
1:10: We call it the iPad
1:11... it's the best browsing experience you've ever had... (it looks like a big fat iPhone, folks)
1:12: describes how to email... almost lifesize keyboard.. "it's a dream to type on."
1:12: iPad is an awesome way to enjoy your music collection... (Jobs running through the various applications...i.e. YouTube in high-def...)
1:13: Jobs making lots of comparisons and saying it's better navigation experience than a smaller smartphone (Leo Laporte's feed just fuzzed out)

1:18: Jobs shows off closeup of the virtual keyboard
1:19: shows off how to manage photos on the iPad
1:20 <strong>(Editorial: So far, folks, I think we're about par for the course here. .. No huge surprises if you've been following the tablet rumor mill the last few weeks)</strong> 
1:21: Built in ipod in the iPad... no surprise there. (Leo Laporte's audio feed is glitchy again)
1:22: Jobs showing off the calendar function <snoozer!> 
1:24: Jobs showing off Google Streetview and how to find restaurants (sushi in San Francisco, for example)
1:24: Showing off video now, i.e. Youtube in HD.
1:27: movies, tv shows, music videos [so far, this device is heavy on pushing iTunes and YouTube content]
1:28: ipad is half an inch thin and weighs 1.5 pounds. 9.7 inch display ("super high quality", Jobs says) 
1:29: Jobs going over tech specs of the iPad [appears to be around same size as Amazon's Kindle DX]
1:30: wireless networking
1:30 Ten hours of battery life [commentator asks, are those Apple hours or real hours?]

1:35 <strong>Editorial: will this iPad be an ergonomic nightmare for people who try to type with it?</strong> 
1:40: [Experiencing some technical problems on the live feed]
1:40: Showing off the gaming experience on the iPad.
1:41 [Editorial: Listening to Leo Laporte's feed... I have to say, if Apple prices this at $999, I don't think it'll be a winner. Just my 2 cents]
1:42 NYTimes content looks really nice on the iPad.
1:44: Electronic Arts about to show off games on the iPad
1:48 Very cool racing game being demo'ed... [Game console makers may have something to fear from this portable device]
1:49 Now Major League Baseball will show off what it has to offer on the iPad
1:52... here we go: the ebook reader. Jobs makes direct comparison to Amazon Kindle ... new app is called iBooks. ("we're going to stand on their shoulders," Jobs said of Amazon.)
1:53: will have five of the largest publishers in the world supporting iBooks... "and we'll open up the floodgates for the rest of the publishers this afternoon."
1:55 Jobs explains how to navigate on the ebook pages...
1:56 "And that is iBooks..."
<strong>1:57 [FYI: Gizmodo has some good, clear photos of the iPad over at: http://live.gizmodo.com/]</strong> 
1:57: Jobs introduces updated iWork software productivity suite for the iPad
1:59 New versions of Keynote, Pages and Numbers software....
2:02 <strong>[Editorial: I'm not sure anyone was expecting Apple to configure iWork to work on the iPad....pleasant surprise? This device can also be used to do some productive work, too.]</strong> 
2:06 Showing off how to use Pages to make spreadsheets.. [Aside: Imagine that: making spreadsheets with your fingers!]
2:10 $9.99 for each of the three iWork software apps... [Cheaper than I thought -gus]
2:12 Back to Jobs: syncing with iTunes.... 3G wireless data built in... Now what's it cost for data: U.S. Telecom typically charges $60 a month ... we 've got two awesome plans... first gives u 250 MB per month: just $14.99, or an unlimited plan for $29.99... AT&T providing the data .... <strong>No contract</strong>. you can cancel anytime....

      <![CDATA[Why are you complaining about your cellphone bill? Don't you know that the average monthly bill for cellphones has gone down nearly 50 percent since 1988?! 
 
I stumbled across this graph from ><a href="http://www.ctia.org/aboutCTIA/">CTIA</a>, the wireless industry's trade group, yesterday while leafing through its Website. Back in 1988, when cellphones were the size of shoes, the average monthly bill was $95. Cellphones were truly a luxury item. They reached a monthly low in Jun 1998, at $39.88, but then bumped up into the mid-to-high $40s. My back-of-the-napkin guess is that's because feature phones and smartphones started to hit the market (and text-messaging plans started taking off).
 
So, does this make you feel a little better about your wireless bill? Hehe.... :-)

It's not clear by what standard these companies are labeled as "top," but at a glance, it's probably safe to say that they are significant employers. 
 
What I want to hear from you is: Which of these companies is hiring right now and which ones are a great place to work? Let's help each other out.
 
Here's the list, in alphabetical order:
 
* <strong>Boeing</strong> 
 
* <strong>Booz Allen Hamilton</strong> 
 
* <strong>CACI International</strong>

* <strong>General Dynamics Corp.</strong>

<img alt="appleparking.JPG" src="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/technology/appleparking.JPG" width="500" height="652" /> 
 
 
The methods described in the application include using GPS and triangulation to help users locate themselves on a map. Then, using a computer algorithm, the application could send you automatic alerts to warn you if you're about to violate the parking regulations. 
 
It's interesting to note that this isn't just about making your iPhone or whatever other Internet-connected portable device more useful. It's also about creating a venue for potential advertising revenue. 
 
The patent filing states about the invention: <em>"It has been considered to provide advertisements and other information pertaining to a present location of a mobile device. For example, detecting a present location of a mobile device, and providing information, including advertisements, about restaurants in that vicinity is an application that has generated interest."</em>

      <![CDATA[One of the latest patent applications from Apple delves deeper into the company's experimentation with integrating solar power cells with their portable devices, including the iPod and iPhone models. 
 
The patent -- titled ><a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=8&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=apple.AS.&OS=AN/apple&RS=AN/apple">"power management circuitry and solar cells"</a> -- describes a system for a portable device use of solar power to either power the device fully, or assist in providing energy to a battery.
 
The patent appears to be an advancement of a previous patent that Apple filed in 2008, which was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/05/26/solar-lcd-powered-ipods-iphones-and-laptops/">unearthed by MacRumors</a> and which described how the solar panels would be configured on portable devices.
 
What's interesting about this patent is how Apple is integrating "boost" circuitry within the devices so that it can work together with the solar cells to generate power, even when power is already low or nonexistent or if some of the solar cells are obstructed.]]>

In short, kids last year used cellphones and portable multimedia devices <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/media/21times.html?src=twt&twt=nytimes">a lot more</a> than they did in 2004. (But didn't you have a gut feeling that would be the case?)
 
The <a href="http://www.kff.org/entmedia/entmedia012010nr.cfm">highlights</a> of the report: 
 
* Over the last five years, kids in the age range saw a "huge increase" in ownership of cell phones (39% to 66%) and iPods and other MP3 players (18% to 76%).
 
* About three in 10 young people say their parents set rules for multimedia consumption, i.e. TV, video games, computer usage.
