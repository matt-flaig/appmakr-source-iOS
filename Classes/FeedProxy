Some VCs are getting an early Valentine's Day gift from<a href="http://thefunded.com/">TheFunded</a>, the site where CEOs<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/14/wondering-which-partner-at-a-vc-firm-to-pitch-thefunded-now-breaks-out-individual-vc-ratings/"> rate venture capitalists</a> and their firms.  Below you will find the top-ranked individual VCs, as determined by their ratings in 2009.  What makes this ranking particularly useful to entrepreneurs is that it is ratings by other CEOs, often CEOs who have had direct dealings with the VCs they are rating.
 
While this is still a popularity contest of sorts (for instance, the rankings are not based on individual investment returns), presumably CEOs are smart enough to take investment performance into account.  But they also take into account their own personal experiences with the individual VCs.  These are the VCs who CEOs love the most, and not just because they are nice but because they help CEOs do their jobs, which is to build great businesses.  Topping the list is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/terry-mcguire-2">Terry McGuire</a>, co-Founder of Polaris Ventures and a big life sciences investor. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-suster">Mark Suster</a> of GRP Partners is No. 2.  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-sze">David Sze</a> of Greylock comes in at No. 7.  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brook-byers">Brook H. Byers</a> of  Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &#38; Byers is No. 10.  Kleiner's star investor <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brook-byers">John Doerr</a> is No.11  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-moritz">Michael Moritz</a> from Sequoia is No. 32..

<p>Some VCs are getting an early Valentine&#8217;s Day gift from<a href="http://thefunded.com/">TheFunded</a>, the site where CEOs<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/14/wondering-which-partner-at-a-vc-firm-to-pitch-thefunded-now-breaks-out-individual-vc-ratings/"> rate venture capitalists</a> and their firms.  Below you will find the top-ranked individual VCs, as determined by their ratings in 2009.  What makes this ranking particularly useful to entrepreneurs is that it is ratings by other CEOs, often CEOs who have had direct dealings with the VCs they are rating.</p> 
<p>While this is still a popularity contest of sorts (for instance, the rankings are not based on individual investment returns), presumably CEOs are smart enough to take investment performance into account.  But they also take into account their own personal experiences with the individual VCs.  These are the VCs who CEOs love the most, and not just because they are nice but because they help CEOs do their jobs, which is to build great businesses.  Topping the list is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/terry-mcguire-2">Terry McGuire</a>, co-Founder of Polaris Ventures and a big life sciences investor. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-suster">Mark Suster</a> of GRP Partners is No. 2.  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-sze">David Sze</a> of Greylock comes in at No. 7.  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brook-byers">Brook H. Byers</a> of  Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers is No. 10.  Kleiner&#8217;s star investor <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brook-byers">John Doerr</a> is No.11  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-moritz">Michael Moritz</a> from Sequoia is No. 32..</p> 
<p>Anyone who is on this list is well-liked and respected by CEOs.   A total of 84 individual VCs (and some angel investors) made the cut out of 17,834 investment pros listed in TheFunded&#8217;s directory.  To get on the list, each VC had to have at least an average rating of 4 out of 5 and have at least five separate reviews from CEO members of the Funded.  (There are 13,480 CEO members).  No more than one of the five ratings can be negative (a score of 3 or less).  Other VC that made the list include <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/howard-morgan">Howard Morgan</a> (No. 28) and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-kopelman">Josh Kopelman</a> (No. 39) of First Round Capital, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-tai">Bill Tai</a> (No. 29) and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/george-zachary">George Zachary</a> (no. 64) of Charles River Ventures, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/roelof-botha">Roelof Botha</a> of Sequoia (No. 50), <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/fred-wilson">Fred Wilson</a> (No. 60) of Union Square Ventures, and angels <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-maples">Mike Maples, Jr</a>. (No. 43)  and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ron-conway">Ron Conway</a> (No. 61).</p> 
<p>You can compare this list to the <a href="http://trends.techcrunch.com/2010/01/29/vc-leaderboard-top-25-most-active-dealmakers-of-2009/">most active VC firms of 2009</a> to get a sense of the overlap between these rankings and which firms are doing the most deals.  Some other insights that TheFunded shared with us: there was a lot of turnover in VC firms in 2009.  When TheFunded sent emails to all the investment pros in its directory, 38 percent either bounced back or replied with an automated message saying they&#8217;ve left their firms.  None of those people are on this list.  And about one or two firms a week became inactive, or 9 percent of the 4,005 firms listed in its directory.</p> 
<p>TheFunded.com is offering 2 free tickets to the Future of Funding () event on February 18th in San Mateo, where many of the award winning venture capitalists will be attending an awards ceremony, for the best comments about the state of venture capital on TechCrunch (as determined by either the author or TheFunded, TBD TC).</p>

Financial terms of the investment were not disclosed.</p> 
<p>Scanbuy&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scanlife.com/atlantis/">ScanLife platform</a> provides a way for advertisers to provide digital information to consumers through the use of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/08/scanlife-barcode-scanning-for-the-21st-century-and-beyond/">2D barcodes and camera phones</a>. That way, advertisers are able to provide consumers with access to information like product reviews, price comparisons and coupon offers simply by having them scan two-dimensional codes placed on product packaging, a magazine ad or other media. Scanlife can scan traditional UPC barcodes as well as popular 2D barcode formats like Datamatrix and QR Codes.</p> 
<p>According to a statement released by lead investor Motorola Ventures, &#8216;millions&#8217; of people have used ScanLife on a range of <a href="http://www.scanlife.com/atlantis/appdownload.html">mobile devices</a> running Android, BlackBerry OS, iPhone OS, Java and Symbian to date. Scanbuy also claims to have the largest and oldest patent portfolio of any company in the industry, with over 30 patents granted covering the solution.</p>

 This is the story of <a href="http://www.timetoknow.com">Time To Know</a>, an enigmatic Israeli startup that has somehow managed to remain under the radar of Israel's tightly knit startup scene. What makes this feat wondrous is not only because of the daunting challenge the company has chosen to meet, but that it has quietly ramped to 350 employees and no less than $60M in funding—all without attracting attention.
 
Time To Know is the realization of a single man's vision to un-root teaching methodologies from their 19th century origins and thrust them into the 21st century. The entrepreneur is Shmuel Meitar, co-founder of Israeli hi-tech posterchild <a href="http://www.amdocs.com">Amdocs</a>. To appreciate Meitar's commitment, consider this: He is TimeToKnow's sole investor. That's right, the $60M the company has taken in funding all came out of his pocket.]]></description>

 This is the story of <a href="http://www.timetoknow.com">Time To Know</a>, an enigmatic Israeli startup that has somehow managed to remain under the radar of Israel&#8217;s tightly knit startup scene. What makes this feat wondrous is not only because of the daunting challenge the company has chosen to meet, but that it has quietly ramped to 350 employees and no less than $60M in funding—all without attracting attention.</p> 
<p>Time To Know is the realization of a single man&#8217;s vision to un-root teaching methodologies from their 19th century origins and thrust them into the 21st century. The entrepreneur is Shmuel Meitar, co-founder of Israeli hi-tech posterchild <a href="http://www.amdocs.com">Amdocs</a>. To appreciate Meitar&#8217;s commitment, consider this: He is TimeToKnow&#8217;s sole investor. That&#8217;s right, the $60M the company has taken in funding all came out of his pocket.</p> 
<p>The basic thesis Time To Know is operating under is that today&#8217;s current classroom is following a teaching paradigm designed in the industrial age, i.e., a teacher standing in front of a class, a blackboard on the wall and students at their desks. Think of it this way… Imagine time warping a teacher from the 1800&#8217;s and implanting her in a classroom in 2010. She could basically hit the ground running with little to no adjustment in teaching style. Quite scary when you think about it.</p> 
<p>Time To Know believes there are three main reasons why today&#8217;s classroom is ineffective: First, relevancy—or rather, irrelevancy. Kids are living in a digital world with a tremendous amount of stimulus. Expecting them to happily and effectively embrace &#8216;passive learning&#8217; that requires them to just sit, listen and provide output in exams is simply unrealistic. Second, variance. There no such thing as a homogeneous level of learning and comprehension in a classroom of students. Third, assessment—aka, the feedback loop. In today&#8217;s classroom a student could have gotten lost with the material three weeks back, but the teacher would be oblivious to it.</p> 
<p>Contrary to partial solutions such as computerized tutorials, or digital whiteboards, Time To Know set out to create a holistic solution designed to migrate from instructional to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)">Constructivist Learning</a> in which learning and knowledge are experience driven. </p> 
<p>Due to the nature of the work environment (the classroom), and the content (curriculum), Time To Know has set certain infrastructure and operational prerequisites schools must commit to. These are: </p> 
<p><strong>Infrastructure: </strong>Every student must be allotted a laptop or netbook with a headset. No more than one student per machine. Every classroom must also be equipped with a laptop for the teacher that is connected to a projector. A WiFi Internet connection is another prerequisite. Ethernet will not do as it restricts inner-class mobility.</p> 
<p><strong>Support &#038; Professional Services:</strong> Schools committing to Time To Know&#8217;s curriculum must be able to provide on-premises technical support. This means that if a student&#8217;s netbook experiences technical problems, it will dealt with immediately, rather than having to wait for an IT support professional to make a call days after.</p> 
<p>Schools must also commit to provide their teachers with training and support. This sounds obvious, but if mis-handled it could be the Achilles heal of the entire initiative. These services can be provided by Time To Know itself or by a third party. </p> 
<p>For all intent and purpose, Time To Know is a software company whose management application, applets and content, all reside on the cloud and are accessible via web browser. There are two main components to the system:</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/02/israels-time-to-know-aims-to-revolutionize-the-classroom/class_3/" rel="attachment wp-att-140786"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Class_3-180x180.jpg" alt="" title="Time To Know" width="180" height="180" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-140786" /></a><strong>Learning Management System:</strong> This is the teacher&#8217;s command center, a management application that allows the teacher to review each student&#8217;s progress, view trends in the class&#8217; performance, as well as plan for the next day&#8217;s lessons.</p> 
<p>It also allows teachers to customize learning sequences, assign assessments to students, and create reports of student progress. As each student uses a laptop during class, the teacher can monitor individual progress and communicate with each student unobtrusively.</p> 
<p>The application is quite robust, so here are just a few of its many features:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Alert Management: Real-time notifications of student progress that alerts teachers on students that require extra attention and assistance.</li> 
<li>Content Preview &#038; Simulation: Teachers are able to run through lessons at home, allowing them to review lesson plans ahead of class time.
<p>Once the teacher runs through the lesson in the classroom, the system begins to record data such as what learning activities were used, student achievement, etc.</li> 
<li>Gallery: Students can submit their work to the shared Gallery area for peer review and class discussion. Teachers can divide students into groups with unique assignments, and then have the groups share and discuss their work in the Gallery. They can also promote collaboration and peer review by encouraging students to write comments on peer and group projects in the Gallery. These can be performed as part of the lesson, or afterward.</li> 
<li>Administration: Teachers, principals and superintendents can generate various reports to monitor class progress (standard coverage for instance) and achievements (grades). The system allows data analysis, graphing and reporting. The system also comes with an administration component for control of all the technical elements. </li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>The Curriculum: </strong> Time To Know designs and produces what it calls &#8216;full digital curriculum coverage,&#8217; which is a complete year&#8217;s worth of lesson plans, learning activities, and homework assignments. To grasp just what an immense undertaking this is, multiply these by the four subjects matters Time To Know targets—math, science, language arts and social studies—and now multiply that by 13 year&#8217;s worth of education (kindergarten plus 12 formal years of schooling). To put this into perspective, in a single year Time To Know produces animation with a combined length of one and a half feature films.</p> 
<p>The challenge is daunting not only because of the sheer amount of content that requires to be designed and produced, but also because the curriculum has to fulfill alignment to state and country standards. This means that curriculum which received approval in Texas <em>will</em> require tweaking for approval in New York. This explains why Time To Know employees a team of 350 consisting of 120 pedagogy and instructional designers (aka teachers), 60 graphics artists, illustrators and animators and 80 technologists.</p> 
<p>To date, Time To Know has produced yearly curriculums for Israeli schools in the subjects of Hebrew, English and math for 4th, 5th and 6th grades. For American schools, it&#8217;s produced yearly curriculums for 4th and 5th grades in the subjects of math and language arts. By July 2011, curriculums will be expanded to include grades 3 and 6, with curriculums for science added across all four grades.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/02/israels-time-to-know-aims-to-revolutionize-the-classroom/launguage/" rel="attachment wp-att-140781"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Launguage-180x180.jpg" alt="" title="Time To Know - Launguage" width="180" height="180" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-140781" /></a>The curriculum combines &#8216;blended learning&#8217; materials, from movies, to on-screen tutorials, to on-paper exercises. Take for example, 4th grade math aligned to Texas state standards. There are 81 lesson segments, each 120 minutes long. The lesson segments provide a complete coverage and preparation for standardized testing. Lesson segments include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Learning activities based on interactions with Rich Exploration Applets (more on these below). These activities include group, teacher-led, and individual work. </li> 
<li>Instructional games that directly relate to the concepts taught in the segments.</li> 
<li>Guided discussions to help teachers motivate and summarize lesson segment concepts.</li> 
<li>Instructional video clips used to introduce, elaborate, or reinforce lesson segment concepts.</li> 
<li>Review activities that help prepare students for benchmarks and standardize testing.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Teachers do have flexibility and can mix and match lesson plan modules and exercises. There&#8217;s also the ability to add external items such as videos from YouTube for example, or links to sites on the Web. Time To Know discovered from its pilots that American teachers stuck to the structured curriculum, while Israeli teachers took advantage of the flexibility at their disposal and enriched the curriculum with external materials.</p> 
<p>The curriculum is presented to and interacted with by the students through &#8216;Rich Exploration Applets&#8217;. These provide guided learning sequences intended to facilitate the development of cognitive learning skills in a sequential and spiraled manner. The purpose of the applets is to motivate students to explore, experiment, discover, and discuss the concepts presented under each subject. Doing so allows students to form deeper understandings of these concepts and how they can be extended and adapted to new situations. </p> 
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/02/israels-time-to-know-aims-to-revolutionize-the-classroom/geo_b/" rel="attachment wp-att-140775"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Geo_B-180x180.jpg" alt="" title="Time To Know - Geo Board" width="180" height="180" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-140775" /></a>The Geoboard Applet for example (thumbnail on right) is designed to encourage students perform constructive problem solving. It has four areas: The first is the Work Grid in which the student can manipulate different objects, draw lines and polygons, write text, and measure objects. The second area is the Toolbox, which contains different tools for mathematical expressions, drawing, coloring, measuring and entering text. The third area is a collection of visual objects to be placed on the grid. The fourth area is the External Atoms Zone where the student receives instructions and answers different questions regarding his/her conclusions. The atoms, containing the questions and directions, are gradually exposed to coincide with progresses.</p> 
<p>If this isn&#8217;t compelling enough, the system is also adaptive. A component called PAL, which stands for &#8216;Practice and Learning&#8217;, maps each student&#8217;s knowledge in response to answers given in the subjects of math and language arts. As a result, a practice path is then built on the fly to address the student&#8217;s specific strengths and weaknesses.</p> 
<p>Students also have home remote access so they can go over materials that were taught in the classroom, do homework, or review and comment on items in the Galleries.</p> 
<p>Time To Know has been running pilots in four schools in Texas and ten schools in Israel. The expectation for the 2010/2011 school year is for fifteen pilots in the US and around 50 in Israel.</p> 
<p>The feedback collected from teachers is quite interesting: 86% reported an increase in instructional time. There was also a decrease in discipline and an increase in individual assistance during class time. Teachers also reported an increased sense of empowerment to guide and support the learning process.</p> 
<p>Feedback collected from students showed that they perceived the new learning methodologies as fun and relevant. There was also an increase in motivation and positive attitude to subjects taught. Put differently, the kids started enjoying math(!)</p> 
<p>Another dimension was brought from Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Finance and Bank of Israel, which both see TimeToKnow&#8217;s approach as being able to ultimately increase the GDP. </p> 
<p>&#8220;LaAsot Kavod LaMedina&#8221; is an Israeli expression that sums-up Time To Know&#8217;s story. It translates roughly to &#8220;to bring national pride&#8221; and it&#8217;s used to express &#8220;bravo, I&#8217;m proud to be an Israeli because of ________&#8221;. Rarely, if at all, is it used in the context of a startup. In the case of Time To Know though, it fits hand to glove. Respect.</p>

Today <a href="http://www.appolicious.com/">Appolicious,</a> a comprehensive iPhone and Android app directory with a social twist, is acquiring <a href="http://www.appvee.com/">AppVee,</a> a startup that provides in-depth and comprehensive video reviews of iPhone and Android applications on AppVee.com and <a href="http://www.androidapps.com/">AndroidApps.com. </a> Terms of the deal were not disclosed. </p> 
<p>AppVee was one of the pioneers in the mobile app directory space, and was launched in 2008, shortly after the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/app-store-launches-upgrade-itunes-now/">launch</a> of the iTunes App Store. While AppVee has extensive coverage of iPhone apps, the site&#8217;s Android app reviews are also <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/22/android-video-reviews-from-appvee/">comprehensive.</a> As part of the acquisition AppVee reviewers will continue to write for both sites in addition to Appolicious. The sites will maintain their original style, but Appolicious will add more social benefits, such as the ability for users to create profiles, curate their own list of top apps, import their app libraries, and more.</p> 
<p>Appolicious, which just raised <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/16/appolicious-lands-2-million-for-iphone-app-directory/">$1.5 million</a> in funding and debuted an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/21/appolicious-now-delivers-personalized-app-recommendations-to-the-iphone/">iPhone app,</a> tries to make sense of the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/11/04/apples-100000-point-lead/">100,000</a> apps on Apple&#8217;s App Store and the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/16/google-android-market/">16,000 apps</a> on the Android Market, but with a social twist. So not only can you find apps based on category or topic, but you can share those apps with your social graph on Twitter and Facebook, review apps, and more. Via its technology, the application will scan your iTunes directory for your downloaded app and will integrate them into your Appolicious library.  It&#8217;s similar in some ways to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/oneforty">oneforty</a>, an app directory for Twitter. The site also recently added the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/14/appolicious-takes-a-page-out-of-twitters-playbook-lets-users-create-personalized-lists-of-apps/">ability</a> to create curated lists of apps. </p> 
<p>Founded in May of this year by former Yahoo VP, <a href="http://www.participate.com/management-team-bios/">Alan Warms,</a> Appolicious is hoping to expand its platform to include Android, Blackberry and other smartphone apps, which will certainly be accomplished party through the acquisition of AppVee. Warms is a serial entrepreneur who sold his startup Buzztracker to Yahoo in 2007. </p>

Like many people, I have the <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/iphone">Stanza app</a> installed on my iPhone. Made by <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Lexycle</a> (<a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/lexcycle_acquired_by_amazon">acquired by Amazon</a> last year), Stanza is a free app for iPhone and iPod Touch that serves as a gateway to a library of more than 100,000 ebooks for easy reading on the go.
 
Last night, I was prompted to update the app to a new version (2.1), and as usual I checked what the changes were. The accompanying message was pretty brief: 'Removed the ability to share books via USB'.

<p>Like many people, I have the <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/iphone">Stanza app</a> installed on my iPhone. Made by <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Lexycle</a> (<a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/lexcycle_acquired_by_amazon">acquired by Amazon</a> last year), Stanza is a free app for iPhone and iPod Touch that serves as a gateway to a library of more than 100,000 ebooks for easy reading on the go.</p> 
<p>Last night, I was prompted to update the app to a new version (2.1), and as usual I checked what the changes were. The accompanying message was pretty brief: &#8216;Removed the ability to share books via USB&#8217;. </p> 
<p>I thought it was an odd update but didn&#8217;t think much about it, and since I didn&#8217;t actually use that feature simply downloaded and installed the new version.</p> 
<p>Just for your reference: the feature enabled users to transfer books in the ePub or eReader format to their mobile devices <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/faq/how_to_get_books_onto_stanza_iphone#sharing_via_usb">using a USB cable</a>.</p> 
<p>This morning, we got some tips from people who were angry or surprised about Lexcycle removing the USB sharing feature from the Stanza app. I looked up the app in the iTunes Store and saw that the update notice now read &#8216;Removed the ability to share books via USB as required by Apple&#8217;. A glance at the forums on the Lexcycle website revealed that users were <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/node/1965">quite</a> <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/node/1963">upset</a> about the removal of the app, with only some suggesting that Apple may have had something to do with it and offering explanations why they would have demanded it.</p> 
<p>I asked Lexcycle if and why Apple had requested the removal of the feature from the iPhone app via e-mail and swiftly received a short response, saying that Apple had indeed demanded that Lexcycle remove the feature from Stanza. I requested more information but was subsequently told by Lexcycle was strictly &#8216;forbidden from discussing the specifics of our conversations with Apple on this matter&#8217;.</p> 
<p>I&#8217;m sure Apple has good reasons to prevent people from being able to transfer files to iPhone and iPod Touch devices using a USB cable, and I believe this isn&#8217;t the <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/usb_feature_returns_to_fileapp/">first</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/sentience/statuses/8539891749">time</a> they&#8217;ve asked developers of apps with this or similar features to remove them for new users. That said, I&#8217;m not 100% certain which rules were broken here, and since Apple requested Lexcycle not to discuss specifics we&#8217;re left guessing why Cupertino had an issue with the USB syncing features.</p> 
<p>Naturally, this event adds fuel to the fire for the many observers claiming Apple is far too controlling, and it also seems rather suspicious that they&#8217;re targeting an Amazon company in light of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/28/top-10-reasons-ipad-kindle/">increased competition</a> between the corporations in the ereader/ebook field. But in my mind, this is a small, non-essential feature they took away, and <a href="http://www.iphonefreak.com/2010/02/stanza-for-the-iphone-gets-updated-you-may-want-to-hold-off-on-updating-this-one.html">not updating the app</a> to the new version preserves the USB sharing feature for those who deem it to be important enough to raise hell over anyway.</p> 
<p>Do you think Apple is going too far in placing constraints on iPhone applications, or do you think they&#8217;re well within their right to exercise as much control over the whole process as they do? The comment section is all yours.</p>

<p>The Ovi Store is the centralized application shop for programs fit for Nokia devices that the Finnish mobile device giant launched in May 2009. Greystripe offers rich media ads through its ad network, and has seen considerable success with its iPhone platform, and recently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/09/greystripe-launches-ads-for-android/">launched support</a> for Android to ride the tidal wave of growth for the device. Greystripe maintains that its <a href="http://www.greystripe.com/?release=pr44iab">rich media full-screen ads</a> generate higher click through rates and are able to generate better revenue to its publishers. </p> 
<p>Greystripe has created an automated self service web-based portal for developers to ad enable their Java/Symbian apps.  Developers can upload all of their fully developed mobile app ports, while the ad client is automatically merged with their application. Greystripe&#8217;s ad network will display pre- and post-roll full-screen ads within the app. Currently, Greystripe supports over 1,400 Java handset models, in addition to iPhone and Android.  Greystripe will also migrate 1,200 Java titles on its consumer mobile gaming store <a href="http://games.gamejump.com/WhiteLabelWeb/index.htm">GameJump</a> into the Ovi App Store.</p> 
<p>Greystripe has continues to make its ad offerings more appealing and attractive to both developers and advertisers by extending support to various devices and even launching a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/greystripe-ups-the-ante-in-the-iphone-ad-network-wars-launches-guaranteed-cpm-program/">guaranteed CPM program.</a> The company also <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/17/greystripe-and-tribal-fusion-see-success-with-web-to-mobile-ad-campaigns/">partnered</a> with Tribal Fusion to enable online ads to fit on iPhones.    </p> 
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/google-acquires-admob/">acquisition</a> of <a href="http://www.admob.com/">AdMob</a> and Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/04/apple-acquires-quattro-wireless/">acquisition</a> of <a href="http://www.quattrowireless.com/">Quattro Wireless</a> will effect the other ad networks in the space. If anything, these networks will now have to compete with  two of the largest companies in the world. But Greystripe, which recently received a $2 million infusion from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/02/mobile-ad-network-greystripe-gets-a-2-million-infusion-from-nbc-universal/">NBC, </a>is wise to continue to innovate and expand its reach and should be able to hold its own. </p>

<p>While some people are worried that the e-mails might have actually <em>been</em> a phishing attack, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=twitter+phishing">flood of tweets</a> from users having received the same message after effectively getting denied access to their accounts, so this seems 100% legit.</p> 
<p>The message, copied here by a <a href="http://blog.arhg.net/2010/02/what-deuce-twitter-changes-my-password.html">blogger</a>, reads:</p> 
<blockquote><p>Due to concern that your account may have been compromised in a phishing attack that took place off-Twitter, your password was reset. Please create a new password by opening this link in your browser:<br /> 
[PASSWORD RESET LINK].</p></blockquote> 
<p>The message adds:</p> 
<blockquote><p>As a reminder, you should be extraordinarily suspicious of any third party that offers to artificially inflate your follower count. We do not endorse any of these sites.</p></blockquote> 
<p>We&#8217;ve contacted Twitter for more information, but for now it may be wise to change your password regardless of whether you&#8217;ve received this e-mail or not.</p> 
<p>Just yesterday, <a href="http://www.sophos.com/blogs/duck/g/2009/12/06/facebook-id-probe-2009/">Sophos</a> published a report that showed social networking services like Facebook and Twitter are <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/188278/network_attacks_on_facebook_twitter_tripled_in_2009.html">increasingly being targeted</a> in cybercrime attacks.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/research1-215x174.jpg" width="215" height="174" />In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin published a <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf">paper</a>[PDF] titled <em>Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine</em>, in which they outlined the core technology behind Google and the theory behind PageRank.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[><p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/research1.jpg" class="shot2"/>In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin published a <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf">paper</a>[PDF] titled <em>Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine</em>, in which they outlined the core technology behind Google and the theory behind PageRank.  Now, twelve years after that paper was published, the team behind social search engine <a href="http://www.vark.com">Aardvark</a> has drafted its own research paper that looks at the social side of search.  Dubbed <em>Anatomy of a Large-Scale Social Search Engine</em>, the paper has just been accepted to WWW2010, the same conference where the classic Google paper was published.</p> 
<p>Aardvark will be posting the paper in its entirety on its <a href="http://blog.vark.com/">official blog</a> at 9 AM PST, and they gave us the chance to take a sneak peek at it.  It&#8217;s an interesting read to say the least, outlining some of the fundamental principles that could turn Aardvark and other social search engines into powerful complements to Google and its ilk.  The paper likens Aardvark to a &#8216;Village&#8217; search model, where answers come from the people in your social network; Google is part of &#8216;Library&#8217; search, where the answers lie in already-written texts.  The paper is well worth reading in its entirety (and most of it is pretty accessible), but here are some key points:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>On traditional search engines like Google, the &#8216;long-tail&#8217; of information can be acquired with the use of very thorough crawlers.  With Aardvark, a breadth of knowledge is totally reliant on how many knowledgeable users are on the service.  This leads Aardvark to conclude that &#8220;the strategy for increasing the knowledge base of Aardvark crucially involves creating a good experience for users so that they remain active and are inclined to invite their friends&#8221;. This will likely be one of Aardvark&#8217;s greatest challenges.</li> 
<li>Beyond asking you about the topics you&#8217;re most familiar with, Aardvark will actually look at your past blog posts, existing online profiles, and tweets to identify what topics you know about.</li> 
<li>If you seem to know about a topic and your friends do too, the system assumes you&#8217;re more knowledgeable than if you were the only one in a group of friends to know about that topic.</li> 
<li>Aardvark concludes that while the amount of trust users place in information on engines like Google is related to a source website&#8217;s authority, the amount they trust a source on Aardvark is based on intimacy, and how they&#8217;re connected to the person giving them information</li> 
<li>Some parts of the search process are actually easier for Aardvark&#8217;s technology than they are for traditional search engines.  On Google, when you type in a query, the engine has to pair you up with exact websites that hold the answer to your query.  On Aardvark, it only has to pair you with a person who <em>knows</em> about the topic — it doesn&#8217;t have to worry about actually finding the answer, and can be more flexible with how the query is worded.</li> 
<p><center><br /> 
 <img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/aardvarkqs.jpg"/><br /> 
</center></p> 
<li>As of October 2009, Aardvark had 90,361 users, of whom 55.9% had created content (asked or answered a question).  The site&#8217;s average query volume was 3,167.2 questions per day, with the median active user asking 3.1 questions per month. Interestingly, mobile users are more active than desktop users.  The Aardvark team attributes this to users wanting quick, short answers on their phones without having to dig for anything. They also think people are more used to using more natural language patterns on their phones.</li> 
<li>The average query length was 18.6 words (median of 13) versus 2.2-2.9 words on a standard search engine.  Some of this difference comes from the more natural language people use (with words like &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;the&#8221;, and &#8220;if&#8221;).  It&#8217;s also because people tend to add more context to their queries, with the knowledge that it will be read by a human and will likely lead to a better answer.</li> 
<li>98.1% of questions asked on Aardvark were unique, compared with between 57 and 63% on traditional search engines.</li> 
<li> 87.7% of questions submitted were answered, and nearly 60% of them were answered within 10 minutes.  The median answering time was 6 minutes and 37 seconds, with the average question receiving two answers.  70.4% of answers were deemed to be &#8216;good&#8217;, with 14.1% as &#8216;OK&#8217; and  15.5% were rated as bad.</li> 
<li>86.7% of Aardvark users had been asked by Aardvark to answer a question, of whom 70% actually looked at the question and 38% could answer.  50% of all members had answered a question (including 75% of all users who had ever actually interacted with the site), though 20% of users accounted for 85% of answers.</li>

				<description><![CDATA[><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/obamau-108x200.jpg" width="108" height="200" />Streaming video site <a href="http://ustream.tv">Ustream</a> has just pulled in a massive new round of funding: $75 million. This second round was led by <a href="http://mb.softbank.jp/en/">SoftBank</a>, a Japanese telecom giant. Previously, the site had <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ustream">raised</a> just below $13 million in funding, which came from its Series A in 2008 and its angel round in late 2007.
 
<strong>Update</strong>: While Ustream noted the $75 million number, SoftBank has <a href="http://www.softbank.co.jp/en/news/press/2010/20100202_03/index.html">clarified</a> that they're investing $20 million now for a 13.7% stake in the company with an <em>option</em> to invest up to $55 million more by 2011 — which would make them Ustream's largest shareholder with over 30% of the outstanding shares.
 
Perhaps even crazier is that the service is saying that additional funding commitments are pending from other investors in the U.S. and Asia, so the round could actually be larger than the $75 million when all is said and done. We're hearing reports that there was quite a bit of competition to be involved in the round, and apparently all the dust hasn't settled yet.]]></description>

This second round was led by <a href="http://mb.softbank.jp/en/">SoftBank</a>, a Japanese telecom giant. Previously, the site had <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ustream">raised</a> just below $13 million in funding, which came from its Series A in 2008 and its angel round in late 2007.</p> 
<p><strong>Update</strong>: While Ustream noted the $75 million number, SoftBank has <a href="http://www.softbank.co.jp/en/news/press/2010/20100202_03/index.html">clarified</a> that they&#8217;re investing $20 million now for a 13.7% stake in the company with an <em>option</em> to invest up to $55 million more by 2011 — which would make them Ustream&#8217;s largest shareholder with over 30% of the outstanding shares.</p> 
<p>Perhaps even crazier is that the service is saying that additional funding commitments are pending from other investors in the U.S. and Asia, so the round could actually be larger than the $75 million when all is said and done. We&#8217;re hearing reports that there was quite a bit of competition to be involved in the round, and apparently all the dust hasn&#8217;t settled yet.</p> 
<p>So why on Earth does Ustream need $75 million+? CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-ham">John Ham</a> says in the release that the money will be used to expand on the other side of the world, particularly Japan (obvious, given the SoftBank involvement), China, Korea, and India. Mobile video is particularly hot in some of the Asian countries where their faster wireless networks allow for more functionality than the comparatively slow ones in the U.S. Ustream will open offices and hire staff in all those countries, apparently.</p> 
<p>Alongside this new round, we&#8217;re also hearing that the founders of the company, Ham, Brad Hunstable, and Gyula Feher were able to sell some shares as a reward.</p> 
<p>Just a few days ago, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/28/ustream-producer-desktop/">Ustream launched a new desktop client</a> to help video producers give their work a more professional feel. Prior to that, in December, Ustream made headlines by being the first big video streaming site to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/09/iphone-live-streaming-ustream/">offer that (recording) functionality on the iPhone</a>.</p> 
<p>Ustream says that its iPhone apps has been downloaded over 1.5 million times to date (it has had other apps before the live streaming one was available too) and notes that 3.8 million people tuned into the service to watch the inauguration of President Obama in January of last year.</p> 
<p><strong>Update</strong>: SoftBank&#8217;s investment appears to put Ustream&#8217;s value right now around $150 million. However, if they exercise their options, their full investment in Ustream would push its value to around $230 million.</p>

Stealth startup <a href="http://www.makara.com/">Makara</a> is launching publicly tonight with its cloud-based application deployment and management platform. Formerly known as <a href="http://www.webappvm.com/">WebappVM,</a> Makara has raised angel funding from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-horowitz">Ben Horowitz.</a> The startup also raised $6 million last year from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/shasta-ventures">Shasta Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/sierra-ventures">Sierra Ventures.</a> 
 
Rather than offer a system management software designed for traditional application environments to the cloud, Makara’s cloud-based platform leverages the virtual layer to allow developers to rapidly deploy, scale and monitor applications in cloud environments. The product, which is self-service and self-managing, is available for free on its site. ]]></description>

Formerly known as <a href="http://www.webappvm.com/">WebappVM,</a> Makara has raised angel funding from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-horowitz">Ben Horowitz.</a> The startup also raised $6 million last year from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/shasta-ventures">Shasta Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/sierra-ventures">Sierra Ventures.</a> </p> 
<p>Rather than offer a system management software designed for traditional application environments to the cloud, Makara’s cloud-based platform leverages the virtual layer to allow developers to rapidly deploy, scale and monitor applications in cloud environments. The product, which is self-service and self-managing, is available for free on its site. </p> 
<p>The startup&#8217;s platform allows developers to deploy new or existing web applications to a public or private cloud with no code changes. Once the application is deployed, developers can control the application runtime and have cluster-wide visibility into end user response times end-to-end through the entire stack. Makara’s offering supports Java, Flex, PHP, JBoss and Tomcat applications and runs on Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud, Terremark vCloud Express, VMware ESX, VMware Workstation, VirtualBox and Xen. Makara faces competition from <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/03/25/rpath-helps-businesses-deploy-applications-in-the-cloud/">rPath.</a> </p>

Late last week, I wrote a post about how netbooks running <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/29/ipad-chrome-os/">Chrome OS and the iPad were on a collision course</a>. Some people took exception to that, noting the iPad was only a touchscreen device while Chrome OS was created to be used with more traditional computing form factors, like netbooks and laptops. But there's a new concept video that has surfaced on <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience/form-factors/tablet">a Chromium Project page</a> that very much shows how the two could and should compete head-on in the touch tablet space.
 
Again, this is just a concept video at this point, but it clearly shows what the people building Chrome OS are thinking about for future products. Oh, and in case you're worried that since Chromium OS is an open source project, this is just some random person making these videos that Google is unlikely to use for Chrome OS, they were made by Glen Murphy, <a href="http://glenmurphy.com/about/">a Googler working on Chrome</a> (with a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/chromes-new-feature-click-the-ui-designer-to-close-the-window/">sense of humor</a>).

It&#8217;s worth noting that Google&#8217;s tablet concept video was uploaded January 25, two days before the iPad unveiling.</p> 
<p>For more of a taste of what Google has in mind with these tablets, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/01/google-tablet-photos/">check out the concept pictures as well</a>. Watch the video below.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/chromeos1-215x161.jpg" width="215" height="161" />Last week, the world saw Apple's long anticipated tablet device, the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/01/27/crunchgear-live-at-the-apple-event-listen-read-and-watch-as-it-happens/">iPad</a>, for the first time.  In the aftermath since that announcement, a few things have become clear: it will be great for some people, but its apparent lack of flexibility (at least in its first iteration) may leave something to be desired.  It's increasingly looking like the best alternative will be Google's Chrome OS, which is clearly on a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/29/ipad-chrome-os/">collision course</a> with the iPad.  And tonight, we've come across some very impressive mockups of what Chrome OS may look like on a tablet form factor.
 
The photos have been posted to the official <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience/form-factors/tablet">Chromium site</a> (Chromium is the open source project behind Chrome and ChromeOS).  And while Chromium is not actually part of Google, it appears that these mockups were put together by Glen Murphy, Google Chrome's designer.  In other words, there's a good chance that the final version of Chrome OS will resemble this.

And tonight, we&#8217;ve come across some very impressive mockups of what Chrome OS may look like on a tablet form factor.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Be sure to watch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/01/chrome-os-tablet-video/">this video</a> to see a mockup of the tablet in action.</p> 
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that there almost certainly will be multiple &#8220;Google Tablets&#8221;, given that Chrome OS won&#8217;t be tied to a single device.  That said, Google is working with select <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/17/get-ready-for-the-google-branded-chrome-os-netbook/">hardware partners</a> to ensure that it runs on devices that are up to its specifications, and there may be one tablet device that is designated as the &#8220;Google Tablet&#8221;, much like the Nexus One is the &#8220;Google Phone&#8221;.</p>

Co-founder Andrew Lee says that the site is up to around 60 million total song plays, of which 45 million have come from registered members.  He says the site has seen especially good growth since it integrated Facebook Connect.
 
For those that haven't used it before, JamLegend takes the music-as-a-game formula popularized by games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, and brings it to your web browser.  Gameplay is pretty simple: a series of colorful dots scroll down the screen, each representing a note or chord in a song, and you rhythmically tap the proper keys on your keyboard to "play" each note.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[><p><a href="http://www.jamlegend.com"><img class="shot2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-712.png" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.jamlegend.com">JamLegend</a>, the <a href="http://www.launchboxdigital.com/">LaunchBox</a>-backed &#8216;Guitar Hero For The Web&#8217;, has just reached a fairly major milestone: it&#8217;s now signed up over 1 million users.  Co-founder Andrew Lee says that the site is up to around 60 million total song plays, of which 45 million have come from registered members.  He says the site has seen especially good growth since it integrated Facebook Connect.</p> 
<p>For those that haven&#8217;t used it before, JamLegend takes the music-as-a-game formula popularized by games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, and brings it to your web browser.  Gameplay is pretty simple: a series of colorful dots scroll down the screen, each representing a note or chord in a song, and you rhythmically tap the proper keys on your keyboard to &#8220;play&#8221; each note.</p> 
<p>To play a song on JamLegend, it needs to have a note chart.  The site offers 630 professionally crafted note charts (and their corresponding songs), and last summer it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/jamlegends-guitar-hero-for-the-web-now-lets-you-play-any-song-youd-like/">added</a> support for an automated system that can generate a note chart for any song.  In practice the system isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s probably good enough for casual gamers. JamLegend monetizes these songs by restricting how many you can upload at a time — if you&#8217;d like to store more than a handful at once, you have to sign up for a premium subscription.  Lee says that users have uploaded over 600,000 songs to their virtual lockers.</p> 
<p>Lee says that JamLegend&#8217;s community is playing a strong role in helping it get traction.  He says that indie musicians often come to the site and upload their own songs, and then members of JamLegend&#8217;s community task themselves with converting those songs into quality note charts.  In effect, it&#8217;s giving these bands another outlet to get new fans, and Lee says that some of the bands have managed to get more fans on JamLegend than they have on MySpace.</p> 
<p>One other thing worth noting: while <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/jamlegend.com/">Compete</a> shows JamLegend&#8217;s traffic taking a dive over the winter, Lee says that their data is off.  Instead, he says that traffic has largely been flat recently, but that it hasn&#8217;t dipped. Still, the company is going to have to come up with some innovative features to get to critical mass, especially as options like the <a href="http://creators.rockband.com/">Rock Band Network</a> become increasingly enticing to indie bands.</p>

While the systems themselves are fine (and fast) there have been a ton of reports about problems with the screens (including mine and at least one other TechCrunch writer). Apple issued an update on December 21 that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/13/27-inch-imac-screen-fix/">did not fix the problem</a> for most of those users. Today, they have issued another update — so far, so good.
 
While the December 21 update was titled "27-inch iMac Graphics Firmware Update 1.0," this new update is called "<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/firmware_hardware/27inchimacdisplayfirmwareupdate10.html">27-inch iMac Display Firmware Update 1.0</a>." A slight variation, but a big one, as this apparently is altering the display firmware itself rather than that of just the graphics card. As with the other update, this takes a few minutes to install. This update is also about half the size of the previous one.]]></description>

Today, they have issued another update — so far, so good.</p> 
<p>While the December 21 update was titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/firmware_hardware/27inchimacgraphicsfirmwareupdate10.html">27-inch iMac Graphics Firmware Update 1.0</a>,&#8221; this new update is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/firmware_hardware/27inchimacdisplayfirmwareupdate10.html">27-inch iMac Display Firmware Update 1.0</a>.&#8221; A slight variation, but a big one, as this apparently is altering the display firmware itself rather than that of the graphics card. This update is also about half the size of the previous one. As with the other update, this takes a few minutes to install.</p> 
<p>Earlier today, it was r<a href="http://www.hardmac.com/news/2010/02/01/production-of-all-imac-27-core-ix-models-stopped-by-apple">eported that Apple was halting production</a> of the 27-inch iMacs until it could solve the issues afflicting the line. Aside from the screen flickering issue, other iMacs apparently have a yellow-tinting problem. As reports of troubles kept piling in, indications were that Apple was seeing long wait times for the devices, which some attributed to popularity, while others attributed to these problems.</p> 
<p>The <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2212682&amp;tstart=0">Apple Discussions forum</a> on the topic now has some 271 pages (up from 191 a couple weeks ago) of comments/complaints and over 500,000 views (up from 400,000 a few weeks ago). It has more views than all the other threads combined — by far. Apple still has yet to say officially what the problem is with the product, and why the original update didn&#8217;t fix the issue. Hopefully this update will once and for all.</p>

Hadden (John Hurt) says, &#8220;<em>why build one when you can have two at twice the price?</em>&#8221; Apple, it seems, may have the same line of thinking.</p> 
<p>By now, we&#8217;ve all seen the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/tablet">iPad</a> and know just about everything about it that we possibly can. But did you know that the secretive company may actually be hard at work on a second device already? Now, before I say anything else, take this information with a grain of salt. While it originated from a good source, it was a second-hand source. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve corroborated some the main details with another source, but not some of the smaller ones. That said, from what I&#8217;m hearing, Apple is pretty far along on work on second tablet device. A bigger one. And this one may be much more like a Mac than an iPhone.</p> 
<p>Before the iPad was revealed last week, rumors circulated for a long time that Apple might be working on two different sizes for the screen of the device. Some had the device <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/12/23/apple-tablet-definitely-coming-in-7-size/">as small as 7&#8243;</a>, others were saying it would go <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091118PB201.html">up to 10.6&#8243;</a>. (The actual size of the iPad <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/">is 9.7&#8243;</a>.) But the information we&#8217;re hearing is that Apple is thinking much larger for another version of the product, maybe all the way up to the 15.4&#8243; size that it currently uses for one version of the MacBook Pro. If you think that would be way too big for an iPad, we&#8217;re also hearing that this other tablet would be quite a bit different from the one revealed last week. Namely, it could run a version of OS X much closer to the traditional version that runs on Macs.</p> 
<p>If there is any truth to that, we could learn something as soon as Apple&#8217;s WWDC event this year, which will likely take place in June (just as it does every year). Apple typically uses the event to show off its new iPhone hardware, but it is first and foremost an event for Mac platform developers, and the past two years have seen OS X as a major component. This included two years ago when Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) made a surprise appearance and developers got a very early peek. There is already <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet">talk</a> that WWDC 2010 could bring a similar peek at OS X 10.7. If there are some significant multi-touch components to OS X 10.7, you can expect the rumors to start flying about this new device that I&#8217;m talking about (or possibly <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/02/01/ipad-rumor-wrap-up-and-likelihood-of-22-inch-touchscreen-imac/">touchscreen iMacs</a>).</p> 
<p>As usual, you should also note that Apple likely has a ton of projects in various stages that never see the light of day. It seems certain that at points they were playing with different sized screens for what became the iPad. But one of our sources here puts this new tablet as being released within the next year.</p> 
<p>While everyone is still debating <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/30/bigger-better-ipad-arc-computing/">the uses of the iPad</a>, a larger tablet would probably have a completely different set of uses. For example, it would likely be meant to be more of a straightforward laptop (or desktop) replacement. As such, it would almost undoubtedly come with some sort of external keyboard/stand just as the iPad offers as an accessory, but it would probably be a more integral part of using the device. When undocked, maybe you could use the thing just as you would an iPad (which is to say, holding it or placing it in your lap and using your fingers to manipulate its screen). And maybe while docked, you would even use a bluetooth mouse or touchpad device attached to the keyboard to interact with it.</p> 
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-140602" title="macb15" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/macb15.png" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></p> 
<p>Based on various patent filing and the general trend of multi-touch enabled devices (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/magic-mouse-is-apples-best-mouse-ever-but/">Magic Mouse</a>, MacBook trackpads, etc) that Apple has been releasing, it seems that Apple is definitely <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/25/apples-tablet-islate/">trending</a> in the direction of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/29/touching-all-rumors-point-to-the-end-of-keysbuttons/">touch computing as the future of computing</a>. A larger tablet device could serve as a nice <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/31/ipad-moms-next-computer/">transition</a> device between the traditional laptop and this new type of computing. And just as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/27/ipad/">the iPhone has prepared many of us</a> to naturally use the iPad, the iPad may do the same for this new tablet.</p> 
<p>And while a larger screen tablet would undoubtedly cost more than the iPad, Apple would have a lot of room to price it if it really was meant to be a laptop-replacement. If that&#8217;s the case, anything north of $1,000 wouldn&#8217;t seem unreasonable, unlike it would have for the iPad.</p> 
<p>That said, for that type of price, people are going to expect a machine that is as powerful as a laptop. We&#8217;re also hearing that Apple would likely use an Intel chip (just as it uses in traditional Macs) in such a device rather than its new custom-made A4 chip. The problem with that would be power consumption. A larger screen plus a power-hungry chip would likely lead to a battery life well below the stated 10-hour limit for the iPad. Still, if they could bring something like that in with around around 5+ hours of battery, plenty of people would be happy. And Apple has made a lot of advancements in the past couple of years with getting battery life on its laptops well above industry averages.</p> 
<p>In terms of weight, the iPad is 1.5 pounds, while the MacBook Air is 3 pounds (with a 13.3&#8243; screen). If Apple could remove all the unnecessary parts of the MacBook Air (like the keyboard and trackpad), it could probably keep a device pretty close to the 2-3 pound weight even with a larger screen. But given such a large screen, it would almost undoubtedly have to come with some kind of case to put it in so as not to damage the screen when in transit.</p> 
<p>In terms of what OS X applications could or would support multi-touch integration, that&#8217;s hard to say. Safari is an easy and obvious one, but others would have to be completely reworked for this. But as we saw during the iPad keynote, Apple didn&#8217;t need too long to do that with its iWork suite of apps. Third-party developers would likely get a good set of tools from Apple to update their apps as well. Again, take this all with a grain of sale, but look for clues in OS X 10.7.</p>

<p>There are a couple of downsides to this feature. Sadly, you can only star the story that Google News deems to be the most important in the cluster (that it places first). Clicking on a more detailed view removes the option to star any articles. Also, they say that you can only keep track of your last 20 starred items in the new <a href="http://news.google.com/news/section?cf=all&amp;topic=ss&amp;ned=us&amp;ict=ln">Starred</a> area — that seems pretty low. Also odd is that if the cluster changes after you star it (meaning a different story rises to the top), it appears to also change in your starred items area.</p> 
<p>Still, this makes Google News much more interesting to me already.</p>

<p>Who exactly is the market leader in textbook rentals is no longer just an academic debate.  Online textbook rental service <a href="http://www.chegg.com/">Chegg</a> recently sent its rival <a href="http://www.bookrenter.com/">BookRenter.co</a> a lawyer letter (embedded below) demanding that it stop using the phrase &#8220;#1 In Textbook Rentals&#8221; on its Website.   That is Chegg&#8217;s marketing slogan, and it even registered the phrase as a <a href="http://www.trademarkia.com/1-in-textbook-rentals-77346107.html">trademark</a> in 2008.  </p> 
<p>But how can a company trademark being No. 1, especially in a nascent market that is evolving rapidly?  In addition to Chegg and BookRenter, bigger players <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/11/barnes-noble-college-textbook-rental/">such as Barnes &#038; Noble</a> are getting into the textbook rental game.  Chegg&#8217;s trademark isn&#8217;t going to do it much good in fighting off such encroachments.  And even if Chegg is the biggest online textbook renter, the offline book rental market is much bigger with companies like <a href="http://www.follettsoftware.com/">Follett</a> dominating.</p> 
<p>BookRenter.com CEO Mehdi Maghsoodnia stands his ground and says Chegg doesn&#8217;t have a case.  To begin with, there are many ways to define &#8220;#1&#8243;: customers, revenue, selection, service.  &#8220;We have the largest selection of textbooks in the U.S.,&#8221; claims Maghsoodnia, referring to the inventory of 3 million textbooks that BookRenter can rent out by tapping into partner inventory such as Amazon.  Chegg operates its own warehouses, but it claims to offer &#8220;more than 4.2 million titles&#8221; and has rented out more than 2 million books to students so far.  BookRenter.com says it serves 5,000 universities in the U.S.?  Okay, Chegg claims 6,400.  BookRenter says its revenues are growing 400% annually?  Chegg tops it with a claim of 600% growth.  Needless to say, none of these assertions are backed by any audited financial statements.</p> 
<p>The point is that this market is growing fast and Chegg wants no one to question its undisputed number-oneness.  Maghsoodnia concedes that in terms of customers and revenues, Chegg is probably five to seven times bigger than BookRenter, which recently passed 100,000 customers.  And Chegg certainly has more capital.  It has a massive war chest from raising <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/chegg">$144 million</a> over the past few years, whereas BookRenter.com only recently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/22/textbook-rental-market-heats-up-bookrenter-raises-6m-series-a/">raised $6 million</a>.  But Maghsoodnia points out that estimates of the total online textbook rental market are $200 million, out of a $7 billion overall market.  So for any online player to claim to be #1 in all textbook rentals is laughable.  The fact that Chegg is trying to assert its trademark on such a dubious claim, he says, &#8220;tells me they are a lot more nervous than their advertising shows.&#8221;</p> 
<p>Regardless, he doesn&#8217;t think Chegg can defend its trademark claim on such a common phrase, unless it could establish some sort of secondary meaning in the eyes of the public. At least that is what his lawyers tell him. In the meantime, he is thinking of changing the language on his Website just a little bit to, &#8220;We&#8217;re Numero Uno in Textbook Rentals!&#8221;</p>

<p>The loans are co-payable to the school, and Fynanz takes into account tuition and other expenses to make sure students don’t take out more than they actually need. The plus for the student is that loans are offered to students with low interest rates, often 0.60% to 1.0% lower than what a student would get from a bank. Fynanz faces competition from fellow student lending platform <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/02/greennote-offers-more-peer-to-peer-loans-to-tackle-the-college-funding-gap/">GreenNote.</a> </p>

The chat bar, which also makes it easy to share content, now reaches 110 million unique visitors according to Quantcast (74 million according to comScore), and is growing at a clip pace.  But not everything has gone exactly according to plan — on certain sites, the chat bar isn't being used as much as Meebo would hope.  Today, the company is looking to change that by modifying the way it authenticates users.  From now on you will no longer need to sign up for a Meebo account to access all of the Meebo Bar's features — you'll be able to enter your credentials for services like AIM, Google Talk, and Facebook Chat and use all of the functionality immediately.
 
I spoke with Meebo Senior Director of Product Chris Szeto and Director of Business Development Daniel Bernstein about the changes. They say that one big misconception people have about the Meebo Bar is that while it has a very broad reach, that doesn't necessarily mean a lot of people are using it — people who visit a partner site see the bar even if  they never touch it.

But not everything has gone exactly according to plan — on certain sites, the chat bar isn&#8217;t being used as much as Meebo would hope.  Now the company is looking to change that by modifying the way it authenticates users.  Starting later this week, you will no longer need to sign up for a Meebo account to access all of the Meebo Bar&#8217;s features — you&#8217;ll be able to enter your credentials for services like AIM, Google Talk, and Facebook Chat and use all of the functionality immediately.</p> 
<p>I spoke with Meebo Senior Director of Product Chris Szeto and Director of Business Development Daniel Bernstein about the changes. They say that one big misconception people have about the Meebo Bar is that while it has a very broad reach, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean a lot of people are using it — people who visit a partner site see the bar even if  they never touch it.  The Meebo team says that engagement is higher than you might expect, and that 32% of its users are authenticated. But that stat comes with one big caveat: up until now, the majority of authenticated users have been on sites like MyYearbook and Justin.TV, which already have their own authentication systems in place.  In other words, publisher sites that don&#8217;t already have their own social graphs haven&#8217;t been seeing the chat feature get much traction. Meebo is hoping today&#8217;s changes will fix that.</p> 
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/meeboauth1.jpg" alt="" /></p> 
<p>The problem so far has stemmed from the way Meebo prompts users to start using the service. If you go to MyYearbook and sign in as usual, you&#8217;ll see your MyYearbook friends show up in you Meebo Bar buddy list. If you go to a publisher site that doesn&#8217;t have a friend system already, Meebo will still let you chat through third party services like Facebook Chat and Google Talk. But up until now, in order to do that you&#8217;d have to first sign up for a Meebo account. Only after that was done would Meebo let you start using AIM, Facebook Chat, Google Talk, and the others. But most people didn&#8217;t make it past the first hurdle of signing up for a Meebo account — why sign up for a new account just to access the ones you already have?</p> 
<p>With today&#8217;s change, Meebo is getting rid of that hurdle. Now you&#8217;ll be able to enter the credentials of whatever service you want to start using from the get-go. Meebo will lose out slightly because it will no longer be getting people to sign up for its own Meebo accounts, but few people were signing up for them anyway so they&#8217;re not missing out on much. The plus side for Meebo is that they&#8217;ll likely see their authenticated user stats increase even further.  When a user is authenticated with the Meebo Bar, it means that they&#8217;ve logged in and Meebo is presenting them with a list of their chat buddies, which makes it one metric to measure engagement. Even if a user doesn&#8217;t start chatting, Meebo benefits from having an authenticated user because it learns some key demographic information, like age and gender (which it can use to serve better ads).  Obviously it&#8217;s in their interest to get more people authenticated and chatting.</p> 
<p>I think this will help the Meebo Bar on publisher sites, but engagement on these sites will still trail the social networks Meebo is integrated with.  On community sites that already have established social graphs, there&#8217;s an inherent sense of community that prompts chatting and sharing that you may not get from a standalone publisher site.  Users may eventually get used to the idea that nearly every site can be social, but it will take time.  </p> 
<p><b>Update</b>: Meebo points out that while the authentication stats for publishers have been low, they&#8217;ve still seen &#8220;very good&#8221; share activity through Facebook, Twitter and other services (you have never needed a Meebo account for these).</p>

By now, there are a few thousand available, and that number just got multiple by several times as Google has announced that the latest official version of Chrome, version 4, now natively supports Greasemoneky user scripts.</p> 
<p>As Google engineer <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/aaron-boodman">Aaron Boodman</a> (who also happens to be the creator of Greasemonkey) <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/02/40000-more-extensions.html">writes today</a> on the Chromium blog, on the popular site <a href="http://userscripts.org/">userscripts.org</a> there are over 40,000 scripts alone.

He also notes that Google will continue to work on issues on their end to improve compatibility with these Greasemonkey scripts.</p> 
<p>While neither side is likely to admit it, this is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/10/chrome-firefox/">another big blow to Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox browser</a>. Boodman wrote <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> in 2004 specifically for Firefox, and now he&#8217;s just helped a rival browser implement the majority of these scripts natively. And in fact, the native support works so well that Chrome actually treats these user scripts just like regular Chrome Extensions, so you can install and disable them in the same way you do with regular ones.</p> 
<p>Boodman cautions users who choose to install these user scripts to be careful, as they can potentially access private data you&#8217;re browsing on a website. He notes that you should read the comments and descriptions on a user scripts&#8217; page to figure out exactly what it&#8217;s doing before installing it. Still, there are a ton of very useful Greasemonkey user scripts out there, and this makes Chrome even better.</p> 
<p>While obviously, Chrome 4 is only officially launched for Windows, the beta versions available for both Mac and Linux are also version 4. And actually, the newer dev builds across all platforms are already onto version 5, so these user scripts should work fine on all of them.</p>

Continuing his series of Davos interviews, Michael talks to <a href="http://www.slide.com/">Slide</a> CEO and founder Max Levchin in the video above.  Levchin discusses the " shift from advertising to virtual goods" and reveals that most of Slide's revenues now come from sales of virtual goods, whereas it was the reverse a year ago.  Slide makes some of the most popular apps on Facebook and other social networks, and the fact that it is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/04/slide-opens-sales-office-in-new-york-seeks-to-justify-huge-valuation/">no longer focussed on advertising</a> says a lot about the prospects for social ads.  Last year was a huge transition for Slide, made possible by the fact the company has raised a total of<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide"> $78 million</a>.
 
Levchin is now steeped in the dynamics of virtual goods and how to get people to pay for them, which he discusses at length in the interview.  He makes a distinction between buying virtual goods as a "consumption decision" (because you want to level up in a game immediately, for instance)  and an "investment decision" where you spend to improve your standing in a community.  He believes there are "less diminishing returns" in getting consumers to make see spending on virtual goods as an investment rather than just consumption.  ]]></description>

<p>Transcript courtesy of <a href="http://www.phonetag.com/">PhoneTag</a>:</p> 
<p>Mr. MIKE ARRINGTON: Mike Arrington here, I&#8217;m here with a very tired Max Levchin, CEO and founder of Slide. How are you?</p> 
<p>Mr. MAX LEVCHIN (CEO, Founder of Slide): Good.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: You’re wearing a suit today. You never wear suits.</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: I never wear suits.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Kind of a world economic forum thing.</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: It is.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: No sleep at all? You&#8217;ve been up late working?</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Up late working but some sleep. Just the sleep depriviation several days that&#8217;s what gets to you.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: It adds up. </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Yeah.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: So, tell me, I haven&#8217;t talked to you in a while, tell me about Slide, how things are going and where it is going.</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: We’re doing well. We&#8217;ve evolved as a business in a pretty cool way. I think a year and a half ago we made, all the money that we made is from advertising. At this point, we make almost all the money that we make through sales of contents to consumers which is a pretty huge transformation for a business at our scale and is a relative success. We have expanded our product line. We’ve realized that some products weren’t going to last so we changed them. But, the most interesting is really the shift from advertising to virtual goods. We&#8217;re going to do that more. Probably the most interesting wrinkle in virtual goods that we have is, we also think once we enable our users to create the goods as opposed to us which we believe in a scalable model and we&#8217;re going down that road pretty well.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: You always sell toward cash. You don&#8217;t do much in a way of offers other than some stuff with flowers or something like that, right?</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: We’ve done exactly one offer.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: The one with flowers?</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Yeah. Actually it was pretty cool. It was a… strange people&#8230;</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: You know that guy whispered “thank you” in my ear because he was filming us, he was filming me filming you. I wonder who it was.</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: That&#8217;s very meta.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: He was behind me. Is that what he&#8217;s doing, he&#8217;s filming me filming you?</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: He&#8217;s doing more than that, probably more than that. Anyway, yes we&#8217;ve done exactly one offer type of thing which was really demand discovery as opposed to demand generation. Demand generation is very tricky. It&#8217;s really easy to create from demand generation to lead generation which is an easy thing to drive towards pretty unethical behavior is a slippery slope. Demand and discovery is a lot easier to deal with but it&#8217;s also a lot harder to execute. And so, we’ve done one experiment (unintelligible).</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: If you buy flowers for somebody…</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Yeah, if you&#8217;re getting something already.</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: But you didn&#8217;t like it, you didn&#8217;t like the financial results. You felt it was a slippery slope or…</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: No, no, from the moral compass perspective, it was pretty -</p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: It&#8217;s clearly okay?</p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Yeah, absolutely. In fact I would recommend it to others. This is neither something I&#8217;m ashamed of nor do I think it&#8217;s a bad business; it&#8217;s just hard to do well. If you&#8217;re looking for scalable direct to consumer sales behavior where you&#8217;re making things or somebody&#8217;s making things and they&#8217;re selling through the users and it&#8217;s a smooth process creating a really nice smooth demand discovery is hard because then you say, alright, well, it&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day, so we should do flowers. It&#8217;s pretty manual labor. It ultimately winds up being about as lucrative as just direct sales merchandising. So, ultimately it’s neither cannibalistic nor massively mass improvement over just direct sales which offers certainly is massive improvement because all sorts of people had said, I will never spend money, pretend spend, through that, which is how you wind up on a slippery slope. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: What percentage of customers can you convert to giving you money &#8211; single digit, couple percent, five percent? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: I think we are well within the industry average. So, it’s – between one and three percent. I think 3 percent in the Western markets is fantastic and I always certainly say it’s fantastic for us. Below half percent is what most people I think can get to and we tend to float substantially better than the lowest and well within the best. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: What happens to the other 97 or whatever percent? Are they there to get other users and to have some ads reserved? Is that basically their use? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: We don’t do much ads or in fact, we’ve really cut down our advertising efforts by quite a significant margin. Not that we don&#8217;t think advertising is a bad business. We do think that commodity advertising is a bad business. So, if you’re in a world of just click on this banner and just get more, it’s hard to get privacy well accounted for. So, a large scale pure reach, just give me anyone or even some modest marketing, low price CPM advertising I think is a declining business in general, but certainly within the world of social networks. Because, in that case, the only differentiating feature is reach and reach is firmly in the hands of Facebook and MySpace. So, at any one time, the only way you can compete if you’re a social advertising network or platform or whatever, is on price. And that is just – that’s another slippery slope I’d like to not be on. </p> 
<p>Now, slipping around to a high-end or brand advertising where the audience is uniquely predisposed towards the brand or towards the transaction being promoted, that’s an excellent business model. You look at, before the current, our times, the mortgage refinancing ads, I think, went for like $60 CPM and still probably go for similar amounts of money on sites that have to do with personal finance. Same exact ads on the front page of some random gaming portal will probably go for very little because they’re just pure (unintelligible). So, having the extremely targeted advertising is still a lucrative business even on social networks. An even better version of this and which is what we’re interested in is what is essentially product placement. If you can work a brand successfully into the narrative of your product, then it’s really cool. Then people actually take the brand up and say, my positive experience in your product is directly connected and influenced by this brand and that worked great. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: So, in a virtual world, having a can of Coca-Cola should have been an ad sitting and having fun. </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: If Coca-Cola is listening, I’d love to have their cans in my virtual world.  </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Do you find, this is a little off topic, back to the old topic. Do you find that users that pay, their friends are more likely to pay? Or that statistically they’re only three percent likely to pay? How do you find those ones that actually pull their wallet out? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: I think the best predictor is their commitment to the product. You can predict whether they will or will not pay both to backing up for a second, there are two ways we think of virtual goods and this is possibly leading to us but I think it’s one good way to split up. </p> 
<p>One is the consumption decision, one is an investment decision. The consumption decision is if you’re playing a game and you’ve got to level up and you just can’t wait another 24 hours for your crops to mature, for your fish to be sold or whatever, and so you pull out a dollar and say, oh look, I used to be level 15, now I’m level 16 which is great. It works and it is a true consumption decision. It is like watching a movie, you don’t really expect anything in return but you had a lot of fun. </p> 
<p>Investment decision is where you are involved in a proto community or perhaps a real community and their conversations, they’re not necessarily on the game topic or a topic of whatever the community was originally formed around, where your standing in the community matters, where you have a voice where people care for who you are and how you differ from others and most of all, you care. If you’re really committed, you start caring a lot. In fact, you’re willing to invest in your standing and personality within that community which is the other way in a virtual-based goods become relevant where your avatar or persona or whatever term is somebody actually are willing to actually invest in cash. The ones I’m most interested in are the latter because they are ultimately a more scalable model in a sense that people are less likely to say diminishing returns. I graduate from level 15 to 16 for a dollar, grow to 500 to 501 for a dollar. Why would I possibly give out in two to 503? And some people are very happy to keep going but on average, I believe, there’s diminishing returns which just has to be. Most people don’t level up to over 500 on anything. </p> 
<p>On the other hand, in a real world, as people gain standing and status in their community, they actually do invest more in it. You can join in a parent teacher’s association, next thing you know, you’re donating money to it and helping with the after-school activities. And that’s very possible. So, the investment type, virtual goods I think are probably somewhat more sustainable although they do have their shelf life and their lifespan. The predictor of that behavior is commitment. Will you join the PTA? Are you going to go post on the feedback forum or are you going to help others get better at this game? So, that’s what we found to be the best way to predict that. The thing that you first referred to, my friend is spending money, maybe I should spend money follows naturally from that second type of behavior. It also does sort of follow from the first type of behavior but that’s competitive. You’re level 15, I’m still level 14, if I got to beat you, I got to beat you. I think most people in social gaming or social entertainment in general are on average not as competition driven as they are driven by other means. And community is one of them but also escapism, the desire to have complete control over the process to understand in real life but don’t have full control in their own world, e.g. people play – there’s farming games I think in a big way because it’s something I understand, is very complex and they could never accomplish in the real world, but having a farm that sits there and just produces revenue even if it’s completely virtual is pretty awesome, you can control it. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: How long does it last, those types of games? How long does the user last, a month on average, less? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: I think it really depends on the game. But there are several different retaining factors. One is content. If the game designer produces more content than he can consume per month, some fraction of the people will say more quests, more tests, more challenges, more whatever and they will be compelled by it. There are diminishing returns there as well. At a certain point he will say – well, this challenge is kind of like the one from last month and I already solved that one. The other retention factor obviously is the community. If you play with your friends and they’re still playing, you’ll probably have higher odds of playing. There are lots of other things and they all add up to some sort of retention curve. That retention curve, it drops down to zero within 30 days then you have a – 30 days of their attention. I think it really – I will only go as far as claiming that from most products their retention curves are not too similar. I mean there are products that have incredibly high retention, and incredibly low retention.   </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: So what about this year for you? What’s going to happen to Slide this year? Any new big product launches that you’re excited about, you want to talk about now? Raising good money that you want to talk about? This is the one like (unintelligible) easy questions. </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Right. There are some product launches that I’m excited about, that I’m not willing to talk about. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: New games and applications.  </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Yes.  </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: And this is all still Facebook, MySpace focused? Looking at mobile at all?  </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: On mobile, there are several questions in there so I’ll choose which one I want to answer. The mobile view that we have is as follows. It’s a fantastic extension of a committed community or committed group that exists on the web, and whether it is from the Facebook or MySpace or on any destination site or – it doesn’t really matter that much. But given the distribution cost and dynamics on the web versus the same on mobile, makes a great deal of sense to tell someone to take your favorite game with you versus discover your favorite game on mobile even if mobile is in some cases certainly is more compelling or more lucrative or whatever, just the footprints that it needs to get to, to become financially interesting is much easier achieved as a buyer instead of the people from a Facebook game extending it to their iPhone than a hundred percent of people discovering it through the App Store, for us. I think there are many companies that have mastered the App Store distribution to the point where they can get to a similar financial footprint, but I don’t think that’s a core competence for Slide. Probably it isn’t likey to change this year although hoping to do that one if I can figure out how to do it, I’ll definitely try. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Anything else? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Pretty exciting here for us. I think so. A lot of really interesting maturation that will happen in the overall industry. I think many different assumptions will be challenged. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: You want to expand on that a little bit, like which assumptions? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Assumptions of – assumptions of what it means to have a successful social app and possibly the assumption of what categories are going to be successful in social apps. I think this may be the year where things start becoming more blurred about what’s a game, what’s not a game.  </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Interesting.  </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: How do I delete that part? It’s way too vague, even I think it’s vague. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: It’s vague but it sounds like it’s begging to be unpacked a little more. For instance, are you talking about taking Slide social tools and extending them over to platform to other things? By things I mean other apps for other people, other sites, other… </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: I think what we’re trying to get to is in effect a platform where some of the content is created by the users and… </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Yeah, they create a shirt and then other people sell it or something. </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Or they create a shirt and then they sell it. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Right. But even other people could theoretically.  </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Sure. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: I mean, you know, I’d love to have, you know, there’s virtual gifts on Facebook, occasionally I give one. I’d love to be able to create my own gift and give it. It would be really cool if it was so popular other people will give it. That’s the kind of thing you’re talking about? </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: That’s certainly a big part of what we think we’re going to do. And if you look at the historic expertise of our company, it is in the tool-making skill of enabling consumers making something out of practically nothing. And I don’t mean to disrespect the occasionally fabulous but mostly just nice and sentimental pictures that people have but combined with our now five-year-old slideshow product…  </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Has it been that long?  </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Maybe it’s been four-and-a-half years, four years, but it’s been around and it’s helped at this point millions of people who go from regular expected to pretty awesome and I think in some cases that pretty awesome becomes financial lucrative. So, we try to think of ourselves as enablers of that. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Right. That sounds like that’s all you’re going to give me right now. You’ve been generous with your time. I’d love to hear more about these when you guys are ready though. </p> 
<p>Mr. LEVCHIN: Sure. </p> 
<p>Mr. ARRINGTON: Thanks, Max.  </p>

<p>Flook is a location-based service that has both a web app and an iPhone app. It can probably best be described as a <a href="http://stumbleupon.com">StumbleUpon</a> for location-based discovery, as that&#8217;s pretty much how you use it.

Users browse these cards on the main screen either by simply scrolling through cards near them or cards from people they follow on Flook. The cards you like the most, you can &#8220;collect&#8221; to view later.</p> 
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the newer features of the application being announced alongside the funding:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>: Cards can easily be tweeted, either from the web, or from your phone by enabling settings for those who want to use flook to interact with their other social networks.</li> 
<li><strong>APIs</strong>: APIs are in closed beta as we are still installing the nuts and bolts, but we encourage companies with interesting applications and integration plans to contact us at info@flook.it.</li> 
<li><strong>Flickr Import</strong>: This is a really cool way to auto-generate flook cards from geolocated flickr photos. Just tag your photo with one of our keywords (for example, flookfunny to make a funny card), and your photo&#8217;s title becomes your flook card&#8217;s title, with its description becoming the caption. At the moment this functionality is limited to a few people we really like &#8211; people with great content on the web that they want to share with their followers, enabling them to find their content when they&#8217;re out and about.</li> 
<li><strong>New Content Partners</strong>: One of the first of our new partners is Ghost Signs (http://flook.it/community/ghostsigns/). Now, if you&#8217;re out and about in London you&#8217;ll easily be able to track down Sam&#8217;s great content &#8211; and use the back of the flook card to start a discussion on it. The Ghost Signs cards are examples of hand painted advertising on walls which are part of a wider collection held within the History of Advertising Trust Ghostsigns Archive. The archive opens for business on 19th March 2010. Flook helps Sam get the word out.</li> 
<li><strong>Collection &amp; Following on the Web</strong>: Hey, this is cool! We’ve increased the synergy of flook and its web-based interface. Now when someone emails you a flook card, and you follow the link to the web, you can collect that card for later, or follow its creator. This is a great way to make a great collection of stuff to do when you&#8217;re out and about with your iPhone.</li> 
<li><strong>Translation</strong>: When not exploring our local area, we are feeding our imaginations by looking at the cards that flookers make all around the world. We have brave flookers starting communities in places as diverse as Taiwan, India, China and Australia. Up until now, we&#8217;ve been able to admire the photos, but I haven&#8217;t had a clue what people were flooking on about. But now you can just tap the card to bring up the HUD and hit the translate button to turn &#8220;G’day mate, this dunny is cactus&#8221; to &#8220;Hello my good man, I&#8217;m afraid this lavatory is inoperative&#8221;. Although this feature is in its infancy (you can&#8217;t translate comments yet), we think it has great potential. Soon, we think you&#8217;ll all be exploring Darkest Peru and Outer Mongolia with flook, and getting fantastic tips for places to visit from the locals rather than the same old same old from an expat guidebook author who probably doesn&#8217;t even speak the language.</li> 
<li><strong>We love widgets!</strong> Now, if you have your own website, but love to flook, you can invite your people to follow you on flook with a handy widget that you place on your site.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Flook is an interesting way to find a variety of location-based information. It doesn&#8217;t emphasize the popular check-in model like Foursquare or Gowalla, or the game-heavy model like MyTown, and instead focuses on visual aspects. The new Flickr import ability seems like a great idea to extend this usage.</p> 
<p>Two of Ambient Industries founders, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/roger-nolan">Roger Nolan</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jane-sales">Jane Sales</a>, are perhaps best known for their work at Psion, where they contributed the code that would eventually become the Symbian OS.</p>

<p>In the midst of massive headcount cuts, another AOL exec is departing the newly-independent company.  Ralph Rivera, previously the Vice President of AOL Games and AOL Latino, where he was responsible for AOL&#8217;s portfolio of online casual games and helped expand its international reach, is leaving to become President of <a href="http://www.mlgpro.com">Major League Gaming</a>, Online.  MLG is a small but growing professional competitive video game league.  Rivera will be tasked to lead digital strategy and online product development for the growing company.</p> 
<p>Major League Gaming has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/11/interview-with-matt-bromberg-ceo-of-major-league-gaming/">shown strong growth</a> in the past few years.  The company claims 10 million unique visitors per month, more than double from a year ago, and 6 million video streams. The company has taken <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/major-league-gaming">$46 Million</a> in funding since inception and have recently landed Doritos and Hot Pockets as advertising partners.</p> 
<p>Rivera believes MLG is at an &#8220;inflection point&#8221; and hopes to help it scale into a larger property.  He joins a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/26/aol-loses-its-chief-lifestreamer-david-liu/">growing</a> list of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/aol-cto-ted-cahall-leaving/">long-time executives</a> to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/21/grant-cerny-aol-kickapps/">jump ship</a> as AOL begins to purge 1/3 of its workforce.  As the churn continues, many AOL vets are starting somewhere else instead of building up the &#8216;New AOL&#8217;.</p>
